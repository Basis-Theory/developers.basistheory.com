# Configure SSO with Okta

[Okta](https://www.okta.com) is a powerful identity provider that offers Single Sign-On (SSO) and other identity management features. Using Okta, you can easily manage user authentication across multiple applications, including Basis Theory.
This guide will walk you through setting up SSO with Okta in the Basis Theory Customer Portal.

<Alert>If you encounter any issues during the SSO configuration process, contact <a href="mailto:support@basistheory.com">support@basistheory.com</a>.</Alert>

## Configuring the Okta Application

<Alert>These instructions are subject to change and could be out-of-date. Refer to the official Okta documentation for the most up-to-date information and support.</Alert>

To begin setting up SSO with Okta, you first need to create a web application in your Okta dashboard. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Okta admin dashboard.
2. Go to the `Applications` section and click on `Create App Integration`.
3. Select `OIDC - OpenID Connect` as the **Sign-in method**.
4. Select `Web Application` as the **Application type**.
5. Click `Next` to proceed.
6. Fill out your `App integration name` with the desired name (e.g., Basis Theory).
7. In the Sign-in redirect URI, add the following URL: `https://auth.basistheory.com/login/callback`.
8. Click the `X` icon to remove the default `Sign-out redirect URIs`.
9. Select your desired type of **Controlled access**.
10. Leave the rest as is and click `Save`.

Copy the following values, as you will need them later:
- **Client ID**
- **Client Secret**

<Alert type={Alerts.WARNING}>The `Client Secret` is sensitive information and should be kept secure.</Alert>

## Configuring SSO in the Basis Theory Customer Portal

After creating the Okta web application, you will need to configure the SSO settings in the Basis Theory Customer Portal. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to the Basis Theory Customer Portal.
2. Navigate to the `Settings` section.
3. Click on the `Identity` tab.
4. Click the `Create Connection` button.
5. Select `Okta`.
6. Complete the required fields:
    - **Client ID**: Enter the Client ID provided by your Okta application.
    - **Client Secret**: Enter the Client Secret provided by your Okta application.
    - **Domain**: Enter your Okta domain. Click [here](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/find-your-domain/main/) to see how to find your Okta domain.
7. Click the `Create Connection` button.

That's it! You have successfully configured SSO with your Okta application.

## Using the SSO Connection

To use the SSO connection, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Basis Theory Customer Portal.
2. On the login page, click the `SSO` button.
3. Enter your company email and click `Continue`.
4. You will be redirected to your provider's login page, where you will need to enter your credentials.

Afterward, you will be redirected back to the Basis Theory Customer Portal, where you will be logged in.

<Alert>On your first SSO login, a new account will be created. Any accounts previously created with other authentication methods will not be linked to your SSO account.
If you wish to add the SSO account as a tenant member instead of a previously created account, you will need to re-invite the SSO account and use the SSO login method when accepting the invite.</Alert>
