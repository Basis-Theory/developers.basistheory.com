# Configure SSO with Okta

[Okta](https://www.okta.com) is a powerful identity provider that offers Single Sign-On (SSO) and other identity management features. Using Okta, you can easily manage user authentication across multiple applications, including Basis Theory.
This guide will walk you through setting up SSO with Okta in the Basis Theory Customer Portal.

<Alert>If you have any trouble during the SSO configuration process, contact <a href="mailto:support@basistheory.com">support@basistheory.com</a></Alert>

## Configuring Okta Application

<Alert>These instructions are subject to change and could be out-of-date. Refer to the official Okta documentation for the most up-to-date information and support.</Alert>

To begin setting up SSO with Okta, you first need to create a web application in your Okta dashboard. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Okta admin dashboard.
2. Go to the `Applications` section and click on `Create App Integration`.
3. Select `OIDC - OpenID Connect` as the **Sign-in method**.
4. Select `Web Application` as the **Application type**.
5. Click `Next` to proceed.
6. Fill out your `App integration name` with the desired name (i.e. Basis Theory).
7. On Sign-in redirect URI, add the following URL: `https://auth.basistheory.com/login/callback`.
8. Click on the `X` icon to remove the default `Sign-out redirect URIs`.
9. Select your desired type of **Controlled access**.
10. Leave the rest as is and click `Save`.

Copy the following values as we will need them later:
- **Client ID**
- **Client Secret**

<Alert type={Alerts.WARNING}>The `Client Secret` is sensitive information and should be kept secure.</Alert>

## Configuring SSO in the Basis Theory Customer Portal

After creating the Okta web application, you will need to configure the SSO settings in the Basis Theory Customer Portal. To do that, follow these simple steps:

1. Log in to the Basis Theory Customer portal.
2. Go to the `Settings` section.
3. Click on the `Identity` tab.
4. Click on the `Create Connection` button.
5. Select `Okta`.
6. Fill in the required fields:
    - **Client ID**: Add the Client ID provided by your Okta application.
    - **Client Secret**: Add the Client Secret provided by your Okta application.
    - **Domain**: Your Okta domain. Click [here](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/find-your-domain/main/) to see how to find your Okta domain.
7. Click on the `Create Connection` button.

That's it! You have successfully configured SSO with your Okta application.

## Using the SSO Connection

To use the SSO connection, follow these simple steps:

1. Go to the Basis Theory Customer Portal.
2. On the login page, click on the `SSO` button.
3. Fill in your company email and click on `Continue`.
4. You will be redirected to your provider login page, where you will need to put in your credentials.

After that, you will be redirected back to the Basis Theory Customer Portal, where you will be logged in.

<Alert>On first SSO login, a new account is created. Any accounts you have created previously with other authentication methods will not be linked to your SSO account.
If you wish to add the SSO account as a tenant member instead of a previously created account, you will have to re-invite the SSO account and use the SSO login method when accepting the invite.</Alert>
