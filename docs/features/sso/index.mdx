# Single Sign-On (SSO) <Enterprise />

Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication process that enables users to access multiple applications using a single set of login credentials.
This feature is available to all Basis Theory Enterprise customers, providing a seamless and secure login experience.

<Alert>Setting up SSO initially requires an existing Basis Theory account (Username-Password, Google, or GitHub).
After configuration, Basis Theory can transfer tenant ownership to a new SSO account, allowing you to discontinue using the previous account.</Alert>

## Supported Authentication Protocols

SSO with Basis Theory can be configured using the following identity protocols/providers:

- [Okta](/docs/features/sso/configure-sso-with-okta)
- [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](/docs/features/sso/configure-sso-with-oidc)
- [Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)](/docs/features/sso/configure-sso-with-saml)
