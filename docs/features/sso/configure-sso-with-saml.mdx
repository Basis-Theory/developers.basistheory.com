# Configure SSO with SAML

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XML-based protocol used for exchanging authentication and authorization data between an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP).
This guide will walk you through setting up SSO with SAML in the Basis Theory Customer Portal.

<Alert>If you encounter any issues during the SSO configuration process, contact <a href="mailto:support@basistheory.com">support@basistheory.com</a>.</Alert>

## Configuring the SAML Application

When configuring Basis Theory SSO with SAML, you will need to set up your identity provider to communicate with the Basis Theory service provider.
The specific steps may vary depending on your identity provider, but the general requirements are similar.
Refer to your provider's documentation for more details.

When prompted, set the following values in your application:
- **Callback/Login URL**: `https://auth.basistheory.com/login/callback?connection=samlp-<YOUR_TENANT_ID>`
- **Entity ID**: `urn:auth0:basistheory:samlp-<YOUR_TENANT_ID>`

<Alert>If you don't know your Tenant ID, these values are also displayed in the portal after step `5` in the [Configuring SSO in the Basis Theory Customer Portal](#configuring-sso-in-the-basis-theory-customer-portal) section.</Alert>

After creating your application, ensure it can provide the following:

- **Login URL**: The SAML login URL for your provider.
- **X509 Certificate**: The X509 signing certificate for your application, in `.cert`, `.cer`, or `.pem` format.

<Alert type={Alerts.WARNING}>The `X509 Certificate` is sensitive information and should be kept secure.</Alert>

### Attribute Mappings

When configuring your SAML application, provide the following attribute mappings:
- `email`: The user's email address.
- `name`: The user's full name.
- `given_name`: The user's first name.
- `family_name`: The user's last name.
- `nickname`: The user's nickname (optional).
- `picture`: The user's profile picture URL (optional).

## Configuring SSO in the Basis Theory Customer Portal

After configuring your identity provider, you will need to configure the SSO settings in the Basis Theory Customer Portal. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to the Basis Theory Customer Portal.
2. Navigate to the `Settings` section.
3. Click on the `Identity` tab.
4. Click the `Create Connection` button.
5. Select `SAML`.
6. Complete the required fields:
   - **Login URL**: Enter the login URL provided by your application.
   - **X509 Certificate**: Click on `Upload File` and upload the X509 certificate for your application.
7. Complete the [Attribute Mappings](#attribute-mappings) as required.
8. Click the `Create Connection` button.

That's it! You have successfully configured SSO with your SAML application.

## Using the SSO Connection

To use the SSO connection, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Basis Theory Customer Portal.
2. On the login page, click the `SSO` button.
3. Enter your company email and click `Continue`.
4. You will be redirected to your provider's login page, where you will need to enter your credentials.

Afterward, you will be redirected back to the Basis Theory Customer Portal, where you will be logged in.

<Alert>On your first SSO login, a new account will be created. Any accounts previously created with other authentication methods will not be linked to your SSO account.
If you wish to add the SSO account as a tenant member instead of a previously created account, you will need to re-invite the SSO account and use the SSO login method when accepting the invite.</Alert>
