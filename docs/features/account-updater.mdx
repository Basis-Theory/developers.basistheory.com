# Card Account Updater

It’s estimated that subscription businesses lose up to 5-10% of their revenue annually, most of it by accident. Before Account Updater, it was nearly impossible to minimize lost revenue tied to outdated card information.

- Prevent Accidental Churn: Don’t lose customers simply because they lost their card, their card expired or updated their billing address.
- Improve Customer Experience: No one wants to update their card on file on no business wants to ask their customer to update their card. Now you don’t have to!
- Immediate ROI: It’s easy to see the revenue lift by comparing the increase in successful authorizations vs. Account Updater cost.

This control gives companies the ability to reduce subscription declines, and old credit cards on file while optimizing the cost of keeping all credit cards up to date.
