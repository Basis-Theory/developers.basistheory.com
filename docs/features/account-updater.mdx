# Card Account Updater

It's estimated that subscription businesses lose up to 5-10% of their revenue annually, most of it by accident. Before Account Updater, it was nearly impossible to minimize lost revenue tied to outdated card information.

- **Prevent Accidental Churn**: Don't lose customers simply because they lost their card, their card expired, or updated their billing address.
- **Improve Customer Experience**: No one wants to update their cards on file, and now businesses can manage this process more efficiently.
- **Immediate ROI**: It's easy to see the revenue lift by comparing the increase in successful authorizations vs. Account Updater cost.

## How to use Account Updater with Basis Theory

### Basis Theory Account Updater

The moment you store credit cards with Basis Theory, you're able to request updates to those tokenized credit cards by sending us a list of cards you’ve identified for updating. In an effort to provide the most flexibility for scaling payment organizations, we enable merchants to update cards under their own rules—such as those nearing expiration—by sending us a list of tokens to process on demand.

This lifecycle ensures that all tokens, including those created with other providers, can be kept up to date when you provide the list, maintaining the freshest data across all partners and processors.

### Third Party Providers

Basis Theory's allows organizations with new vendors, existing partnerships, or a processor's Account Updater to integrate directly with those APIs - for example, [Pagos Loon](https://pagos.ai/loon/), [Cybersource](https://www.cybersource.com/en-us/solutions/additional-services.html#accountupdater), Chase Account Updater, Adyen, etc. In these cases, our Proxy and Reactors enable your team to keep your credit cards up to date with your vendor of choice.

### Updating a list of cards on demand

We recognize that payment organizations and fintech need to be in complete control over every detail of their payment processing flows, including how credit cards are updated. This control gives companies the ability to reduce subscription declines, and old credit cards on file while optimizing the cost of keeping all credit cards up to date.

Below is a flow diagram explaining how updating a list of card tokens works and find more on our [API Reference](/docs/api/).

Batch Account Updater is ideal for specific merchant-driven scenarios:
- **Merchant-Initiated Transactions**: Identify cards scheduled for charges in the next 7 to 14 days and submit a batch job to update them, ensuring successful transactions.
- **Cards Nearing Expiration**: Target cards expiring within the next 30 days, where issuers are likely to have provided customers with new cards.
- **Cards with Recent Declines**: Update cards that failed authorization in the last 30-60 days, addressing potential outdated details.
- **High-Value Subscriptions**: Prioritize cards linked to recurring payments above a set threshold (e.g., $50/month) to protect key revenue streams.
