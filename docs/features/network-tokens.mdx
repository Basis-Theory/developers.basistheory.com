# Network Tokens <Enterprise />

Network Tokens represent a cutting-edge security feature provided by each card network offering the promise of higher authentication rates, lower costs, and the avoidance of some tokenization fees. These tokens serve as dynamic substitutes for actual card numbers during digital transactions, significantly bolstering security and privacy. Network Tokens are compatible with a wide range of digital wallets and payment applications and remove the need for consumers to update their cards when being issued a new one, ensuring a seamless user experience. Their primary purpose is to enhance the security of digital payments and safeguard sensitive card information, offering robust fraud prevention measures.

## How to use them with Basis Theory

### Any provider you want

The nature of the Basis Theory platform is to never lock you into a single provider or offering, enabling your engineers to build any solution your company needs to succeed in its market. This means you’re able to use our Tokens, Proxy, and Reactors to integrate with a Processor or third-party network token provider that has an API - for example [Pagos](https://pagos.ai), [Cybersource](https://cybersource.com), [Adyen](https://adyen.com/), etc.

### Basis Theory Network Tokens

Basis Theory Network Token Enrichment offers seamless integration to the networks to acquire their tokens without having to fulfill the requirement of becoming PCI Level 1 compliant or developing each one of the network integrations yourself. Once acquired, these Network Tokens work natively with our existing services to get your data to any partner that can accept them. Learn more about the flow of Network Tokens in our Basis Theory Network Tokens section below.

## Basis Theory Network Tokens Overview

### Creating Basis Theory Network Tokens


Th



e creation of a Network Token starts with creating a Basis Theory Token, commonly via capturing the user's credit card data via a checkout form or API call, depending on your use case and PCI status. The next step is to request a Network Token for that record via a simple API Request (e.g. `POST /network_token`), which enriches the original Basis Theory token with the new Network Token and is returned to store within your own systems.

### Customer-Initiated Transactions

Customer-initiated transactions require a cryptogram to be created and sent with each charge. Basis Theory enables each merchant to request a cryptogram for each of their transactions before or during the payment flow. Basis Theory will also update the Network Token enrichment to include this new cryptogram - allowing you to either temporarily hold it within your system or utilize our Expression language without touching the cryptogram.

### **Merchant**-Initiated Transactions

For subscriptions or installment plan transactions, your processor should not require the need for a cryptogram - this removes the need to request a cryptogram for your Basis Theory Network Token for these transactions.

## FAQ

#### Can I store Network Tokens and Cryptograms myself?

Yes! While Basis Theory offers token enrichments to manage them on your behalf, you are capable of storing the Network token and temporarily holding onto the cryptogram for the time of your transaction. This offers the ability to go directly to your Processor without Basis Theory in the middle of your Network Token transactions.

#### How does lifecycle management work with Basis Theory Network Tokens?

Network Token lifecycle management will entirely be managed by Basis Theory within our tokens, when any changes to the underlying Network tokens the enrichment tied to your token will be updated. This removes added complexity from your systems and ensures tokens are up-to-date and ready to be used when you need to charge your customers with them.

#### Do I need Network Tokens and an Account Updater Service?

This depends on your goals as an organization and your overall payment orchestration strategy, some examples of when you may need both are:

- Building complex orchestration with multiple processors that rely on raw PANs
- Optimizing for authorizations between PANs and Network tokens
- Optimizing for cost and finding lower costs for some BINs using PANs

#### How do I get pricing for Basis Theory Network Tokens?

Reach out to our team to get a clear implementation plan on utilizing Basis Theory Network Tokens - typically, understanding your general goal is helpful. Are you looking to test the viability of Network Tokens? Or are you prepared for a comprehensive and all-encompassing solution? In either case, let's talk!

#### Can I generate a cryptogram outside of the payment flow?

Yes. Many merchants want more granular control over the entire process, including making specific calls to get the cryptogram through Basis Theory.

#### Does my processor accept Network Tokens?

Network tokens are a newer technology, this has led to processors and acquirers having varying strategies for implementing Network Tokens within their ecosystem. This makes it increasingly hard to give a definite answer on whether your specific processor will accept Network Tokens - we suggest you reach out to your representative and understand their ability to accept third-party Network Tokens. Feel free to loop us in, we’re happy to help you out.

#### Can I automatically create Network Tokens for every credit card tokenized?

Yes! We are able to turn on functionality to automatically retrieve a Network Token on your behalf whenever you create a `card` or `cardNumber`. Let us know if you’re interested in this, and we can get this enterprise feature activated on your tenant.

#### What is the latency for requesting Network Tokens and Cryptograms?

This varies based on the time of day and Network you’re requesting a token for, although there are some base numbers we’ve seen with merchants using Network Tokens:

- Creating a Network Token is between `600ms` and `1.5s`
- Creating a Cryptogram is between `200ms` and `500ms`

#### Do I own my own TRID / how do I use my own TRID?

Yes. Basis Theory will facilitate creating your TRID (Token Requestor ID) with each of the Networks on your behalf. Once created, you’ll be able to use this ID with any provider in the future.

If you have a TRID from another service provider, we are happy to work with you on utilizing this TRID with Basis Theory.

#### Can I create Network Tokens in batch?

Yes. When your organization is ready, we can bulk-create Network Tokens for any card stored within Basis Theory.  This is extremely important for organizations bringing cards from a processor or adding Network Tokens into their existing card-on-file payment flows.
