# Fingerprints

A fingerprint can be generated at the time a token is created, which can be used to uniquely identify the contents of a token.
Fingerprints are cryptographically secure and cannot be reversed to recover the original token's data,
so they are safe to store in your application and used to compare tokens without retrieving plaintext token data (e.g. for token [deduplication](/docs/concepts/what-are-tokens#deduplication)).

Fingerprinting can either be globally enabled via the `Fingerprint All Tokens` [tenant setting](/docs/api/tenants#tenant-settings-object),
or controlled on a per-token basis by disabling this setting. For new tenants, this setting defaults to `false`,
and its value can be modified either through the [Portal](https://portal.basistheory.com/settings)
or through the tenant [management API](/docs/api/tenants#update-tenant). Note that if this setting is enabled, there is no way
to disable fingerprinting on a per-token basis.

<Alert>
  Since fingerprinting performs a CPU-intensive cryptographic operation, creating tokens without fingerprints will be more performant than
  creating tokens with fingerprints. We recommend that you disable the <code>Fingerprint All Tokens</code> setting in production environments
  and only enable fingerprinting on a per-token basis when it is necessary.
</Alert>

When specifying a [fingerprint expression](/docs/expressions/fingerprints) during token creation, you may provide an expression
that references the `data` and `metadata` variable within an [object](/docs/expressions#objects) expression -
`data` and `metadata` will be bound to the provided token data and metadata, respectively.

Token fingerprints are unique per tenant and [token type](/docs/api/tokens/token-types), so you will get different fingerprints when tokenizing the same data
across different token types, or across different tenants.

## Examples

### Fingerprinting Primitive Tokens

```json showLineNumbers title=Request
{
  "type": "token",
  "data": "111-22-3333",
  "fingerprint_expression": "{{ data }}"
}
```

Fingerprinted Value: `"111-22-3333"`

### Fingerprinting a Property of a Complex Token

```json showLineNumbers title=Request
{
  "type": "token",
  "data": {
    "bank": {
      "routing_number": "021000021",
      "account_number": "1234567890",
      "account_owner": {
        "first_name": "John",
        "middle_name": "Andrew",
        "last_name": "Smith"
      }
    }
  },
  "fingerprint_expression": "{{ data.account_number }}"
}
```

Fingerprinted Value: `"1234567890"`

### Fingerprinting Multiple Properties of a Complex Token

```json showLineNumbers title=Request
{
  "type": "token",
  "data": {
    "bank": {
      "routing_number": "021000021",
      "account_number": "1234567890",
      "account_owner": {
        "first_name": "John",
        "middle_name": "Andrew",
        "last_name": "Smith"
      }
    }
  },
  "fingerprint_expression": "{{ data.bank.routing_number }}|{{ data.bank.account_number }}"
}
```

Fingerprinted Value: `"021000021|1234567890"`

### Transforming Data Before Fingerprinting

```json showLineNumbers title=Request
{
  "type": "token",
  "data": {
    "name": {
      "first_name": "John",
      "middle_name": "Andrew",
      "last_name": "Smith"
    }
  },
  "fingerprint_expression": "{{ data.name.first_name | upcase }} {{ data.last_name | upcase }}"
}
```

Fingerprinted Value: `"JOHN SMITH"`
