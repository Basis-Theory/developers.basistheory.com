import { Alert } from "@site/src/components/shared/Alert";

To start you will need a [Public Application](/docs/api/applications). Click [here to create one](https://portal.basistheory.com/applications/create?name=Collect+Cards&type=public&permissions=token-intent%3Acreate) using the Basis Theory Customer Portal.

This will create an application with the following [Access Controls](/docs/concepts/access-controls):
* Permissions: `token-intent:create`

<Alert>Save the API Key from the created Public Application as it will be used later in this guide.</Alert>
