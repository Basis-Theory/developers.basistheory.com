# What are Token Intents?

A **Token Intent** is a short-lived resource that streamlines data collection and validation before being committed to a token for long term retention.
Token Intents enable [public applications](/docs/concepts/access-controls#what-are-applications), such as web or mobile apps,
to focus on data collection while offloading validation and data governance concerns to the backend (e.g. metadata enrichment, aliasing, deduplication, search indexing).

Token Intents are particularly useful for applications where data authorization or validation (e.g. 3DS, Card Authorization, or $0 Authorization when adding a Card On File) is necessary before creating or updating a token.

## How do Token Intents work?

When you create a Token Intent, the data is securely stored using the same NIST and FIPS-compliant encryption algorithms that power the Basis Theory platform.
Each Token Intent is uniquely encrypted, ensuring the integrity and security of the data for its short lifespan.

Token Intents automatically expire when:

1. They've reached the predefined TTL (defaults to **24 hours**).
2. They've been [converted into a Token](/docs/api/tokens/token-intents#convert-token-intent-to-token).

This behavior ensures no unused or stale data persists longer than is necessary.

## Why use Token Intents?

**Token Intents** provide several key advantages over Tokens:

- **Performance Optimization:** By reducing overhead (e.g. data governance, metadata enrichment), Token Intents can optimize workflows that only require temporary data storage, especially in scenarios like mobile app data handling, pre-tokenization, or proxying for card authorization.
- **Simplified Frontend Logic:**
  - Token Intents allow sensitive data to be handled without implementing complex aliasing or deduplication logic on the frontend, shifting decision-making to the backend.
  - This is especially helpful if you have multiple mediums for data capture (APIs, Mobile, Web applications) to keep tokenization logic centralized.
- **Risk Mitigation:**
  - Token Intents can be used to mitigate exploitation of public API keys, such as fraudulent creation of tokens within a Tenant, by providing a two-step validation process before commiting data to your vault.
  - Untrusted data will be automatically discarded after TTL expiration
- **Cost Optimization**
  - Token Intents help reduce the risks associated with public API key abuse, preventing unexpected costs from unwanted Tokens.
  - By using Token Intents, cost management responsibility over ephemeral untrusted data is shifted to Basis Theory.
- **Flexibility:**
  - Token Intents offer a way to easily manage unvalidated data, giving control over how and when to commit that data to a Token.

## What types of data can I store with Token Intents?

Similar to Tokens, Token Intents can handle various data types, including sensitive financial information like credit cards, bank details, and PII.

## What operations can I perform with Token Intents?

Token Intents are capable of being utilized with the following services where Tokens are used today:

- Proxies with [Token Intent Expressions](/docs/expressions/detokenization)
- Reactors with [Token Intent Expressions](/docs/expressions/detokenization)
- [3DS](/docs/api/3ds/sessions) with Token Intents

This makes Token Intents ideal for scenarios where the data captured may not be valid or accurate and will require additional validation before accepting this data into a Token.

## What if I am delayed in converting a Token Intent into a Token?

Unexpected vendor downtime (e.g. a PSP or Basis Theory outage) or other unforeseen circumstances may prevent you from validating or converting a Token Intent into a Token before its expiration.

In order to mitigate this risk, Basis Theory retains Token Intents for 24 hours by default, allowing you to retry validation and conversion operations within this time window.
If you believe you will require a longer Token Intent TTL, a longer TTL can be requested (up to 48 hours) within in your [Tenant Quotas](/docs/api/rate-limits#default-quotas) in the portal.
