# Elements

Basis Theory Elements are simple, secure, developer-friendly inputs that empower consumers to collect sensitive data
from their users directly to Basis Theory's certified vault.

Think about it as an isolated sandbox within your mobile application that your end users are able to seamlessly
interact with, and which securely communicates with the Basis Theory Vault. Sensitive data is not directly exposed to
your application code, which keeps your mobile application out of compliance scope.

Here's how we make this possible:

- Install one of our [Elements SDKs](#elements-sdks) into your web or mobile application
- Build forms using our **Element** input components
- Interact with the Basis Theory API using **Element** references, not plaintext data
- Own your UI/UX by fully customizing how **Elements** are styled

## Collect Sensitive Data

Data entered by your end users into **Elements** is tokenized and secured within Basis Theory's certified Vault.

Our SDKs provide several types of inputs to collect various types of data, such as the [CardElement](/docs/sdks/web/javascript/types#card-element)
for collecting credit card data and [TextElement](/docs/sdks/web/javascript/types#text-element) for collecting arbitrary textual data.

Elements can be configured to support custom input masking, validation, and transformation rules to satisfy your use cases.

To get started collecting data, check out one of our guides:

- [Collect Data from Web](/docs/guides/collect/collect-data-from-web)
- [Collect Data with React](/docs/guides/collect/collect-data-with-react)
- [Collect Data with Android](/docs/guides/collect/collect-data-with-android)
- [Collect Data with iOS](/docs/guides/collect/collect-data-with-ios)

## Reveal Sensitive Data

Tokens stored within the Basis Theory Vault can be securely revealed to end users without accessing the plaintext
data directly within your application code.

Using one of our SDKs, sensitive data can be securely retrieved and applied to one or more Elements within your UI.
See the section below on [detokenization](/docs/sdks/web/javascript/methods#detokenization) for more information.
