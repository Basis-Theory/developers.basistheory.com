# Access Controls

Basis Theory secures sensitive data as [Tokens](/docs/concepts/what-are-tokens) that are stored within an isolated
compliant environment, called a [Tenant](#what-are-tenants).
Your systems interact with Tokens or Services (e.g. Proxy, Reactors) through the Basis Theory API using an API key that is issued to
an [Application](#what-are-applications).
Access to your Tenant's data is limited by applying access controls to an Application via
[Permissions](/docs/api/applications/permissions) and [Access Rules](#what-are-access-rules)
to ensure services and users only have access to the data they need.

## What are Tenants?

Everything starts with a Tenant in your Basis Theory account. Tenants represent an isolated environment in which your
[Tokens](/docs/concepts/what-are-tokens) and other resources are defined, managed, and stored.
Data is not shared between Tenants, but you're allowed to create as many Tenants as you'd like within Basis Theory.
You can use multiple Tenants to isolate different domains of data, and to support your Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

The user account that was used to create a Tenant in the [Portal](https://portal.basistheory.com)
will be designated as the Tenant Owner. New members can be invited to an existing Tenant through the
[Members](https://portal.basistheory.com/members) tab.
Managing Tenant Members can also be done directly through the [API](/docs/api/tenants/tenant-members).

### Common Use Cases for Tenants

#### Enabling Your Software Development Life Cycle

Companies producing software typically create separate and identical environments to support their development
and release processes. For example, developers and teams create Production environments to house their actual customer
data and multiple non-Production environments to enable quick development and testing of their applications without
impacting their Production systems. Basis Theory allows you to create these logical separations of data
by creating a new Tenant for each environment:

#### Separating Data by Business Unit

Many large enterprise and corporate organizations have multiple business units or properties which have different data needs.
Some business units may not want other parts of the organization to have direct access to data they own and manage.
Creating a Tenant for each business unit enables your organization to isolate and limit access to their data by
issuing an Application with limited access controls to other units within the organization.

## What are Applications?

An Application represents an external software system or service that will be integrated with the Basis Theory API.
Basis Theory's Applications are not coupled to a specific implementation type or technology.
Applications could be a native app on a mobile device, a single-page application in a browser, or a backend service
that executes on a server or in a serverless environment.

Applications within Basis Theory have the following properties and characteristics:

### Name

A short description of the Application describing its intended use, for example "Acme Billing App" or "Acme Mobile App".

### Application Type

- **Private**: Used by a backend system or service that runs primarily on a server or in a serverless environment (e.g. NodeJs, .NET, Java, or Ruby). Private Applications allow the broadest access to Token data as the API Key is expected to be kept private and secured within your systems.

- **Public**: Used for Browser, Mobile, or Desktop applications running natively on a device (e.g. iOS, Android, Windows, etc) where the application is collecting data for tokenization via an API call or using Basis Theory Elements. Public Applications have limited permissions available to ensure the API Key can be safely used within publicly available code.

- **Management**: Used with scripts or the [Basis Theory Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Basis-Theory/basistheory) to manage your Tenant's settings and services (Applications, Reactors, Proxy, etc) without logging into our Portal.

<Alert>There are some <a href="#why-use-sessions">inherent risks</a> associated with embedding a public API key within a public-facing frontend application. Take the time to understand these <a href="#why-use-sessions">risks</a> and consider using <a href="#what-are-sessions">sessions</a> within your frontend applications to mitigate these risks.</Alert>

### Access Controls

An Application is granted access to your Tenant's resources in one of two ways: by granting the Application a set of
Permissions, or for more advanced scenarios, by defining one or more Access Rules.

#### Permissions

For basic authorization scenarios, an Application can simply be granted one or more permissions.
Each Application Type allows a different set of permissions, and you can find a detailed list of them [here](/docs/api/applications/permissions#permission-types).

Token permissions granted to Private or Public applications are applied to all Tokens
(i.e. they are not scoped to a particular [Container](/docs/concepts/what-are-containers) of Tokens).
In order to ensure sensitive data is not inadvertently revealed by an Application, an implicit
[transform](#transform) is applied for each operation:

| Permission   | Transform |
| :----------- | --------- |
| token:create | `mask`    |
| token:update | `mask`    |
| token:read   | `mask`    |
| token:search | `mask`    |
| token:use    | `reveal`  |
| token:delete | N/A       |

This behavior can be customized by defining Access Rules.

#### Access Rules

For more advanced authorization scenarios, Access Rules enable
scoping a set of permissions to a subset of Tokens, and to customize the behavior when returning Token data from the API.
Please see the section on [What are Access Rules](#what-are-access-rules) below for more details.

### API Key

Your Application's API Key is used to authenticate your systems to the Basis Theory platform.
The API Key can be used to make authenticated requests to our API directly, using Hosted Elements,
or using the Basis Theory SDK. These API Keys follow a format similar to `key_<region>_<type>_4qUtg83907AnDem90aJSzcN`.
API Keys should be regarded as highly sensitive, and should be stored a secret within in your environments.

### Expires At

ISO8601 compatible DateTime at which the application will be deleted.

### Application Templates

To help you get started quickly, we provide a set of Application Templates for many common use cases,
such as `Payments`, `Banking`, and `PII Data`.
The available application templates are presented after clicking on the "Create Application" button in the [Portal](https://portal.basistheory.com).

![Application Templates](/img/concepts/application-templates.png)

If you are just getting started with Basis Theory, the `Full Access` template can be useful for testing and prototyping.
This template will create a test Application that has been granted all permissions for interacting with Tokens within your Tenant.
It is important to remember that the `Full Access` template should not be used for production Applications,
and you should always strive to follow the principle of least privilege.

Selecting a template will only pre-fill the Create Application form, and any settings or access rules within the
Application can be customized. Once created, your Application will have no relationship with the template
and can be updated independently.

If you have a particular use case that is not covered by one of the existing templates, you can also create a custom
Application to satisfy your specific requirements by choosing the `Create Your Own` option.

### Common Use Cases for Applications

#### Grant Multiple Systems Access Following the Principle of Least Privilege

A common use-case for Applications is to grant minimal access to multiple systems where each system is only authorized
to perform necessary operations and access a relevant subset of data within a [Tenant](/docs/concepts/access-controls#what-are-tenants).
This could mean that one system is only allowed to collect Tokenized data, another system is allowed to read the data to
perform analytics, and a third system is only allowed to [Proxy](/docs/concepts/what-is-the-proxy/) the data
to an integrated 3rd party but never access the raw data.

![Applications Each System](/img/concepts/access_rules_by_customer.png)

#### Enable partners to use data secured by Basis Theory

Often, businesses need to grant their partners access to their sensitive data â€”
traditionally, these businesses would just export the needed data and send it to their partner.
With Basis Theory Applications, a business can create an Application that is restricted to ONLY the data that partner needs.
In some cases, businesses will not allow their partners direct access to the raw data,
but rather only allow them to [Proxy](/docs/concepts/what-is-the-proxy/) the data to
another API or execute serverless workloads on the sensitive data using Reactors.

![Applications Partners](/img/concepts/applications_partners.png)

#### Manage Basis Theory Assets with Infrastructure as Code

The Management application type allows the Basis Theory platform to be configured entirely via our API.
This enables engineers to write scripts or to use IaC (Infrastructure as Code) tooling such as
[Terraform](https://developers.basistheory.com/guides/manage-applications-with-terraform/) to manage your Tenants and Services without logging into our Portal UI.

![Applications IaC](/img/concepts/applications_iac.png)

## What are Sessions?

Sessions provide an alternative mechanism to grant temporary elevated access to your public applications.

Generally speaking, sessions are created by and issued to a public application (within your frontend) and authorized by a private application (within your backend).
Sessions can be authorized to only access specific tokens or containers, and to perform a limited set of operations on those tokens.
You can learn more about how to create and authorize sessions in the guide [Access Data Using Sessions](/docs/guides/govern/sessions) or
continue reading below to learn more about when to consider using sessions.

### Why Use Sessions?

Most user-facing applications such as checkout pages, mobile apps, etc. integrate with Basis Theory using [Public Application](#application-type) Keys.
They are simple to create and use, yet have very narrow permissions available. You can only use such keys to interact with Basis Theory API in order
to create and update tokens. This intentional design prevents unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. For instance, if a malicious actor gets hold of the Public Key by
reverse engineering your code or inspecting application network traffic, their actions are confined by the application's permissions. This limitation ensures
they cannot read or use any tokenized data.

However, there are still some residual risks with such practice. Leaked Public Application keys could still be used to:

- Create tokens within your Tenant by unauthorized third parties.
- Update existing tokens, if a token ID were exposed or guessed - as long as the Public Application has `token:update` permission.

Using sessions within a Public Application fully mitigates these risks and offers the following benefits over a Public API key-only approach:

- **Prevent Anonymous Use**: Since sessions are authorized by a private application in a backend service that you own, you are able to authenticate all requests for a session.
- **User-Specific Access Controls**: You can apply your own custom authorization logic to limit access to only the tokens that should be accessible by each user.
- **Ability to Read or Use Tokens**: Sessions can be authorized to perform any token operation, not only creating or updating tokens.
- **Limited Lifetime**: Sessions are created just-in-time and are intended to be short-lived - by default, sessions expire after 3 minutes.

<Alert type={Alerts.INFO}>Public Application Keys are geared toward integration simplicity, while Sessions provide broader functionality range and more granular access controls.</Alert>

### Use Cases for Sessions

Sessions enable you to fully mitigate many of the [risks](#why-use-sessions) associated with exposing public API keys, while also enabling use cases
beyond collecting data within your frontend applications.

Sessions are a good fit for the following use cases:

- Revealing tokens in a front end application in plaintext (see [reveal sensitive data with Elements](/docs/concepts/elements#reveal-sensitive-data))
- Calling the proxy or reactors from your frontend application
- Restricting the access granted to public API keys to prevent unauthorized use
  - Only allow tokens to be created by authenticated users in your system
  - Only allow tokens to be updated by authenticated and authorized users in your system

## What are Access Rules?

Access Rules are the building blocks for constructing fine-grained access control policies for an Application.
When performing an operation through the Basis Theory API, Access Rules are evaluated in priority order until
the first rule is found with matching container or conditions. Once a matching rule is identified,
the [transform](#transform) defined on the rule determines
if and how Token data will be returned from the API. If no matching rules are found,
access to the requested resource is denied with a `403 Forbidden` error.

<Alert type={Alerts.WARNING}>Access Rules are currently only supported on Private and Public Application types, and only control access to Token resources. Access Rules are not supported on Management Applications at this time.</Alert>

Access Rules are comprised of the following properties:

### Description

A short description of the rule to help you identify its purpose.

### Container

Access Rules can be scoped to a specific set of Tokens using Containers.
[Containers](/docs/concepts/what-are-containers) are a Token attribute that enable you to logically
organize Tokens into hierarchical paths, similar to a UNIX directory structure.

Permissions granted on a Container are inherited on all sub-Containers. For example, having an Access Rule
granting `token:read` permission on the `/pci/` Container will allow that Application the ability to
read Tokens in the `/pci/low/` and `/pci/high/` Containers.

To specify different access controls on a sub-Container, you may apply another rule with higher priority
that is scoped to the sub-Container. For example, given a rule that grants `token:read` permission on the
`/pci/high/` Container with a `mask` [transform](#transform)
and another rule with lower priority grants `token:read` permission on the `/pci/` Container with a `reveal` transform,
then reading tokens in the `/pci/high/` container will return masked data, and reading tokens in the
`/pci/low/` container will return plaintext data.

### Conditions

Conditions allow specifying more specific restrictions for the access rule to be matched, such as scoping them to a
specific token. For example, having a condition with attribute `id`, operator `equals` and value `<tokenId>`, will
allow the application to only access the token with the given `<tokenId>` ID.

Conditions are mutually exclusive with Container and are currently only available for Sessions.

### Permissions

One or more permissions to be granted on Tokens in the specified Container.
Check out our [API docs](/docs/api/applications/permissions#permission-types)
for a detailed list of supported permissions by Application type.

### Transform

Transforms are applied to the `data` property of a Token within API responses, allowing you to specify which view of
the data is appropriate to expose to the Application. The following transforms are supported:

- `redact` - redacts the `data` property from Tokens
- `mask` - returns masked `data` if a `mask` expression is defined on the Token, otherwise `data` is redacted
- `reveal` - returns the original plaintext `data`

<Alert type={Alerts.WARNING}>Be cautious whenever applying a <code>reveal</code> transform. This is especially true when granting the <code>token:read</code> or <code>token:search</code> permissions, as this will allow your Application to read plaintext data. This may result in your systems being pulled into compliance scope.</Alert>

### Priority

Each access rule is assigned a unique priority value, which specifies the order in which the rules will be evaluated.
Rules are evaluated in ascending priority order, with the lowest numerical value having the highest precedence.

### Common Use Cases for Access Rules

#### Grant Access to a Single Data Classification

Access Rules can be scoped to a specific data classification of Tokens. To enable this use case, first ensure your
Tokens are organized into classification-based [Containers](/docs/concepts/what-are-containers),
for example `/pci/`, `/pii/`, and `/general/`.

![Access Rules](/img/concepts/access_rules_by_classification.png)

#### Grant Access to a Single Customer's Data

Your customers' sensitive data can be partitioned within Basis Theory, for example, to enable you to offer your
customers single-tenant environments that only have access to a single customer's data.
To enable this use case, first ensure your Tokens are organized into [Containers](/docs/concepts/what-are-containers)
by customer, for example `/customer-1/`, `/customer-2/`, etc.
