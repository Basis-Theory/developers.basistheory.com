# Import Cards on File

Migrate credit card data to Basis Theory by extracting and tokenizing stored information from your current payment provider. This guide will walk you through the process and requirements for achieving it securely.

## Understanding the Migration Process
Before starting the migration process it is important to gather a few pieces of information:

- A member of the migration team should have an understanding of the existing payment integration
- Identify the account owner and authorized signers at your organization for the payment processor
- Documentation or descriptions of the outputs from a data migration from your payment processor
- The requirements your payment processor has for any party receiving card data

## Initiating the Migration
Once you have a clear understanding of the migration process, it's time to initiate the actual migration from your payment service provider (PSP) to Basis Theory.

### 1. Contacting the Payment Processor

To get started, you need to reach out to the account owners or authorized signers for the payment processor, they hold the authority to initiate the process on your behalf. Depending on the payment processor, there are different methods to initiate the migration, such as submitting a support ticket or sending a signed letter to a designated email address.

Some processors publicly document the data export process and provide guidelines to their customers. For those who don't, here is a template message you can use:

<Card>
  **from**: John Doe &lt;psp_account_owner@mycompany.com&gt;<br/>
  **to**: PSP Support &lt;support@mypsp.com&gt;<br/>
  **cc**: Basis Theory Support &lt;support@basistheory.com&gt;<br/>
  **subject**: Request for Tokens Export

  Dear &lcub; PSP &rcub; team,

  I would like to proceed with a &lcub; full / partial &rcub; cards on file export.<br/>
  My new provider (CC) is:

  Basis Theory Inc.<br/>
  203 Flamingo Road, Suite 350<br/>
  Mill Valley, CA 94941<br/>
  https://www.basistheory.com<br/>

  1. Timeline - we plan to complete the migration process by &lcub; target date &rcub;.<br/>
  Any guidance or support to expedite this request would be greatly appreciated.
  2. Data format - CSV is preferred

  Regards,
</Card>
<br/>

Notice that by copying Basis Theory Support in the email makes the introduction between the parties. This is an important step to

### 2. Requirements from the Payment Processor

The payment processor may have specific requirements that need to be fulfilled before exporting the data. They may ask the set of tokens to export in a partial migration, the merchant account, among other information.

For the receiving party (Basis Theory), the payment processor may request the public key from Basis Theory to establish a secure and encrypted channel for data transfer. You can find [Basis Theory's Public Key](https://cdn.basistheory.com/pgp/bt.public.gpg.txt) below:

It is also very common that at each migration the processor will request Basis Theory's latest PCI Attestation of Compliance (AOC), which your Basis Theory Account manager can provide.
