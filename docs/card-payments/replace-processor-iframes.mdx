  caption="Own your card data by replacing processor iFrames with modern agnostic elements."

When handling payments, merchants often rely on processor-specific iFrames to collect cardholder data securely. However, this approach can lead to vendor lock-in, limiting flexibility and control over payment processing. To future-proof their business, merchants need a solution that enables seamless processor switching and true data ownership. Basis Theory empowers businesses to replace processor iFrames with vault-agnostic secure elements, unlocking greater freedom and scalability.

In this guide, you'll learn how to set up Basis Theory SDKs to capture cards in a frontend application, Web or Mobile, and securely store the cardholder data as flexible and agnostic token intents within your Basis Theory vault.
