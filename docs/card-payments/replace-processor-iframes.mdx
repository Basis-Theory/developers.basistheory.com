When handling payments, merchants often rely on processor-specific iFrames to collect cardholder data securely. However, this approach can lead to vendor lock-in, limiting flexibility and control over payment processing. To future-proof their business, merchants need a solution that enables seamless processor switching and true data ownership. Basis Theory empowers businesses to replace processor iFrames with vault-agnostic secure elements, unlocking greater freedom and scalability.

    participant bapi as Basis Theory<br>API
    participant mapi as Merchant<br>API

    activate customer
    customer ->>+ storefront: Enter checkout
    storefront -->> customer: Render checkout with Elements
    customer ->>+ bte: Enter card data
    customer ->> storefront: Submit
    storefront ->> bte: Create Token Intent
    bte ->>+ bapi: Create Token Intent
    bapi -->>- bte:  Token intent<br>card information
    bte -->>- storefront: Token intent<br>card information
    storefront ->>+ mapi: Submit checkout
    mapi ->> mapi: Process card
    mapi -->>- storefront: OK
    storefront -->>- customer: Success
    deactivate customer
```

In this guide, you'll learn how to set up Basis Theory SDKs to capture cards in a frontend application, Web or Mobile, and securely store the cardholder data as flexible and agnostic token intents within your Basis Theory vault.

## Alternative/Local Payment Methods

This guide focuses on replacing processor iFrames for collecting **cardholder data** using agnostic secure elements. If you need to tokenize other credential types, refer to the links below:
- [Bank accounts (ACH)](/docs/guides/banks/collect-bank-accounts)
- [Google Pay](/docs/guides/google-pay/accept-payments)
- [Apple Pay](/docs/guides/apple-pay/accept)

If you also support alternative and local payment methods (APMs/LPMs) like SEPA, iDEAL, Boleto, and WeChat Pay, you can remove tokenizable payment methods (such as cards) from your PSP’s frontend components while keeping non-tokenizable options as-is.

<Alert>Whenever possible, we recommend integrating directly with providers like PayPal and Klarna for greater control and reduced dependency on intermediaries.</Alert>

## Next Steps

Now that you’ve replaced processor iFrames with agnostic secure elements, the next step is to process payments using your newly tokenized card data. Check out the following guides to complete your integration:

- [Verify a Card](/docs/card-payments/verify-card) – Ensure the card is valid by performing a $0 auth.
- [Charge a Card](/docs/card-payments/charge-card) – Process a payment using the stored token.
