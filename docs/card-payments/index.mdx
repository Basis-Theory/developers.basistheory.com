### Step 1 - Agnostic Acceptance

**One Form. Any Gateway. Maximum Conversions.**

Ensure payment acceptance across multiple gateways while reducing compliance complexity and increasing reliability. By adopting an agnostic approach, you reduce PCI compliance burdens, eliminate the hassle of juggling multiple PSP frontends or iframes, and ensure consistent 3D Secure supportâ€”all backed by unbreakable availability with managed fallback options. This step sets the foundation for higher conversions and operational flexibility.

### Step 2 - Route to your existing processor(s)

**Minimized engineering scope with a future-proofed approach.**

Keep your existing flows and integrations with acquiring APIs while securely routing transactions. This reduces PCI scope and ensures flexibility for future optimizations. By decoupling from specific processors, you protect against risks like processor shutdowns, ensuring long-term stability.

</Card.TwoColumnLayout>

### Step 3 - Consolidate

**Unify Cards. Enable Cross-PSP Routing. Build Smarter Profiles.**

After going live with new card flows, consolidate existing cards into a secure vault to streamline operations, unlock the true potential of fingerprinting and deduplication for unified consumer profiles and seamless cross-PSP routing, and integrate with tools like on-demand data access and point-of-sale systems for greater efficiency.

</Card.TwoColumnLayout>

### Step 4 - Optimize

**Smarter Routing. Lower Costs. Maximum Efficiency.**

Take full control of your payments with dynamic routing and intelligent transaction optimization. Expand your PSP network, reduce costs by minimizing unnecessary declines, and improve approval rates with smarter processing strategies. By leveraging data-driven decisioning, you can fine-tune every transaction to maximize conversions, reduce risk, and create a seamless payment experience.
