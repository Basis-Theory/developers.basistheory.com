### Step 1 - Agnostic Acceptance

One Form. Any Gateway. Maximum Conversions.

Why
- PCI compliance
- No more toggling or switching between many PSP frontends / replace Processor iframed components
- Agnostic 3DS
- 100% uptime iframe guarantee
  - Fallback writing

How
- Replace Processor iFrames
- Authenticate with 3DS
- Use your forms
- Receive via API
- Recollect CVC

### Step 2 - Route to your existing processor

How
- Verify a Card (and save)
  - Pick a PSP for verification ($0 auth)
- Charge a Card (and save)
  - Add a section about charging existing tokens

### Step 3 - Consolidate
- Bring all cards under the same roof

How
- Migration
- Detokenization APIs
- POS

### Step 4 - Optimize
- Add new PSP
- Add routing logic
  - Region
  - funding type
  - Retries


[//]: # (- Store the last four digits and expiration date to later display to the customer)

[//]: # (- Use cheaper debit rails to process debit cards)

[//]: # (- Leverage localized payment processors for cards of a specific region)

[//]: # (- Prevent accepting cards from high-risk issuers with higher chargeback or fraud rates)
