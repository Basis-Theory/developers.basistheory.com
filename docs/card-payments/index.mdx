### Step 1 - Agnostic Acceptance

**One Form. Any Gateway. Maximum Conversions.**

Achieving seamless payment acceptance across any gateway starts with simplifying compliance and maximizing reliability. By adopting an agnostic approach, you reduce PCI compliance burdens, eliminate the hassle of juggling multiple PSP frontends or iframes, and ensure consistent 3D Secure supportâ€”all backed by unbreakable availability through smart fallback options. This step sets the foundation for higher conversions and operational flexibility.

### Step 2 - Route to your existing processor

How
- Verify a Card (and save)
  - Pick a PSP for verification ($0 auth)
- Charge a Card (and save)
  - Add a section about charging existing tokens

### Step 3 - Consolidate
- Bring all cards under the same roof

How
- Migration
- Detokenization APIs
- POS

### Step 4 - Optimize
- Add new PSP
- Add routing logic
  - Region
  - funding type
  - Retries


[//]: # (- Store the last four digits and expiration date to later display to the customer)

[//]: # (- Use cheaper debit rails to process debit cards)

[//]: # (- Leverage localized payment processors for cards of a specific region)

[//]: # (- Prevent accepting cards from high-risk issuers with higher chargeback or fraud rates)

Pick a checkout flow:

### Direct Card Payments
1. Accept Cards
   - (Optional) Authenticate with 3DS
2. Charge a new Card
   - Produces PSP token, NT TX ID (store them)
3. (Optional) Save a Card

### Verify and Charge cards
1. Accept Cards
   - (Optional) Authenticate with 3DS
2. Verify a Card
   - Produces PSP token, NT TX ID (store them)
3. Save a Card
   - Produces BT Token ID (store it)
4. Charge a Card
   - Using PSP Token
   - Using BT Token + NT TX ID (fallback)

### Pay with Saved Cards
1. Using a PSP Token (if you have one)
2. Using a BT Token
   - Recollect CVC (if needed)
   - Charge token

Match your stack:

### Frontend guides
1. Accept Cards
2. Authenticate with 3DS
3. Recollect CVC

### Backend guides
1. Verify a Card
2. Charge a new Card
3. Save a Card
4. Charge a saved Card
