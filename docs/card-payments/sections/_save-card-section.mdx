## Save a Card

Once a card has been processed for the first time, merchants can store details in the long-term for future use and enable express checkouts, repeat transactions for subscription services, recurring payments and consumption-based charges. Merchants are responsible for obtaining explicit customer consent before saving card details, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and fostering trust.

To do that, we can convert the Token Intent into a Token, by calling the [Create Token API](/docs/api/tokens#create-token) and passing the `token_intent_id`.

```shell showLineNumbers title="Create Token"
curl "https://api.basistheory.com/tokens" \
  -H "BT-API-KEY: <PRIVATE_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X "POST" \
  -d '{
    "token_intent_id": "d2cbc1b4-5c3a-45a3-9ee2-392a1c475ab4"
  }'
```

This operation returns a new or existing persistent Token depending on your fingerprinting and deduplication options:

```json showLineNumbers title="Token sample"
{
  // highlight-next-line
  "id": "1cd9c8bf-99fd-4784-ba69-68b15b301019",
  "tenant_id": "74eca6ab-f94d-49bc-9f3c-6144eb3415ac",
  "type": "card",
  "card": {
    "bin": "42424242",
    // highlight-start
    "brand": "visa",
    "last4": "4242",
    "expiration_month": 12,
    "expiration_year": 2025,
    // highlight-end
    "funding": "credit",
    "authentication": "sca_required"
  },
  "fingerprint": "H46vMHviE7DmGM5yCrvo9NkootV6SXX5GrXnaYsjRoXP",
  "_extras": {
    "deduplicated": false
  },
  ...
}
```

What you should store in your database:

1. (Required) The token `id`, associating it with the rightful customer(s).
2. The card details (`brand`, `last4`, `expiration_month`, and `expiration_year`) if your plan to use it for things like rendering a stored card to your customer.
   - Alternatively, you can later [retrieve the token](http://localhost:3000/docs/api/tokens/#get-a-token) to get that information from the API.
3. The **Processor Token** if you plan to directly charge that card with the Processor (without going through Basis Theory Proxy).
4. The **Network Transaction identifier** returned by the processor during the initial transaction;
   - This allows you to seamlessly charge the card with new processors or acquirers in the future and achieve the best approval rates.
   - Refer to your current processorâ€™s documentation or support for guidance on accessing this value.
