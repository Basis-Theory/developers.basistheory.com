## Authenticate Card

Once the Token Intent has been created, merchants can perform various actions to authenticate the user and card, ensuring they are authorized to use the card for a purchase. The specific actions may vary depending on the merchant's risk tolerance or the card's region of origin.

#### 3D Secure

3D Secure (3DS) is a payment authentication protocol that adds an extra layer of verification, such as a one-time password or biometric scan, to enhance security and reduce fraud during online transactions. It is commonly used to meet Secure Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements under regulations like PSD2.

```javascript
if (intent.card.authentication === 'sca_required') {
  // triger authentication flow
}
```
