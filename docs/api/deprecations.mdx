# Deprecations

## Deprecated Features

The following table lists deprecated features and their respective shutdown dates.

| Feature                                                             | Deprecated Date   | Shutdown Date                  | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `request_reactor_id` and `response_reactor_id` removed from Proxies | November 30, 2022 | March 31, 2023                 | In order to simplify management of Proxies, use of `request_transform` and `response_tramsform` has been recommended over Reactors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

For more information, see the section below on [Migrating from Reactor Formulas](#migrating-from-reactor-formulas).                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Migrating From Privacy Settings

Privacy settings were previously used to scope access to Tokens based on their data classification and impact levels.
In order to provide a more flexible access control model that can be customized per Application, we have introduced
Token [Containers](/docs/concepts/what-are-containers)
to logically group Tokens according to any data governance requirements. A Token may be explicitly added to a container
when creating the Token, or if unspecified, a Token will be placed within the container `/<classification>/<impact_level>/`
by default. If you were previously customizing a Token's classification or impact level, please update your systems to
directly set the `containers` attribute instead.

Restriction policies were previously used in conjunction with impact level based read
permissions (e.g. `token:general:read:low`) to define how Token data should be transformed when reading Tokens with
a higher impact level than your permission allows. This model proved to be too inflexible as it was a global setting
applied at the Token level and could not be customized per actor. Restriction policies no longer have any functional
impact, and were replaced by transforms applied via [Access Rules](/docs/concepts/access-controls#what-are-access-rules).

If your systems are using the `privacy` attribute of the [Token Object](/docs/api/tokens#token-object) in API responses, please
update your integration to ignore this attribute as it will be removed on February 1, 2023.

## Migrating From Reactor Formulas

Reactor Formulas were how you added code to a Reactor and configured some of its behavior.
To offer less friction when creating Reactors, we have introduced a new `code` attribute to the Reactor Object.
This attribute is a `string` containing the code that will be executed when the Reactor is triggered.

Alongside not having to create a new formula for each Reactor with different code, this new approach also removes some previous restrictions on `configuration` and `request_parameters`.
Reactors with `code` will not provide validation of the `configuration` attribute or its request parameters, so you will need to perform this validation directly in your code if necessary.

If your systems are using the `formula` attribute of the [Reactor Object](/docs/api/reactors/#reactor-object) in API responses, please update to use `code` instead.
This can be done simply by taking the value for the `code` attribute on the formula and setting it as the value for the `code` attribute on the Reactor.

Below there are some examples on how this operation can be performed by retrieving the formula object and performing a [patch operation] in the Reactor:

You can continue to use your existing Reactors with `formula` until they are removed on a future date, but we advise you to migrate to `code` as soon as possible.
Keep in mind that after migrating to `code` the `formula` will be removed from the Reactor but can still be retrieved for consulting purposes until the shutdown date.
