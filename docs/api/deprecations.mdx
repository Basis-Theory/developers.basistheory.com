## Migrating to List Tokens v2

The [List Tokens v1](/docs/api/tokens#list-tokens-v1) endpoint has been deprecated and replaced by [List Tokens v2](/docs/api/tokens#list-tokens-v2).
The following changes are required to migrate to the v2 endpoint:

- Change from [offset pagination](/docs/api/pagination#offset-pagination) to [cursor pagination](/docs/api/pagination#cursor-pagination).
- Requests containing the `id` query parameter are no longer supported.
  - Use the [Get Token endpoint](/docs/api/tokens/#get-a-token) to retrieve a single tokens by id.
  - Use the [Detokenize endpoint](/docs/api/tokens/detokenize) to retrieve multiple tokens by their ids.
- Requests containing multiple metadata query parameters are no longer supported, e.g. `GET /tokens?metadata.type=phone&metadata.customer_id=1234`
  - Migration Strategy 1: [Client side filtering](#client-side-filtering)
  - Migration Strategy 2: [Alias tokens](#alias-tokens)
  - Migration Strategy 3: [Combine metadata](#combine-metadata)
- Metadata queries are no longer case-insensitive. Update your queries to perform a case-sensitive exact match on key and value.

## Migrating to Search Tokens v2

The [Search Tokens v1](/docs/api/tokens/search#search-v1) endpoint has been deprecated and replaced by [Search Tokens v2](/docs/api/tokens/search#search-v2).
The following changes are required to migrate to the v2 endpoint:

- Change from [offset pagination](/docs/api/pagination#offset-pagination) to [cursor pagination](/docs/api/pagination#cursor-pagination).
- Queries containing the `id` field are no longer supported.
  - Use the [Get Token endpoint](/docs/api/tokens/#get-a-token) to retrieve a single tokens by id.
  - Use the [Detokenize endpoint](/docs/api/tokens/detokenize) to retrieve multiple tokens by their ids.
- Queries combining multiple metadata terms are no longer supported, e.g. `metadata.type:phone AND metadata.customer_id:1234`
  - Migration Strategy 1: [Client side filtering](#client-side-filtering)
  - Migration Strategy 2: [Alias tokens](#alias-tokens)
  - Migration Strategy 3: [Combine metadata](#combine-metadata)
- Metadata queries are no longer case-insensitive. Update your queries to perform a case-sensitive exact match on key and value.

### Client side filtering

Remove one of the metadata terms from the `query` and filter the search results by the other property once returned to your system:

**Original Search Query:** `metadata.type:phone AND metadata.customer_id:1234`

**New Query:** `metadata.customer_id:1234`

**Filter in your system:** `metadata.type = "phone"`

### Alias tokens

Use Aliases to create a single identifier from the multiple terms currently required in a `query`.

Example:

A query with the following multiple terms:

```
metadata.type:phone AND metadata.customer_id:1234
```

Can be converted to the following Alias when creating a token:

```json
{
  "id": "1234_phone",
  ...
}
```

Now systems are capable of requesting this token by the `id` attribute:

```
GET /tokens/1234_phone
```

**This approach will require migrating existing tokens to the new alias.**

### Combine metadata

Combine the multiple terms into a single `metadata` field and continue to use the `query` with a single term:

Original `metadata` field:

```json
{
  "type": "phone",
  "customer_id": "1234"
}
```

New `metadata` field:

```json
{
  "type": "phone",
  "customer_id": "1234",
  "type_customer_id": "phone_1234"
}
```

**Original Search Query:** `metadata.type:phone AND metadata.customer_id:1234`

**New Query:** `metadata.type_customer_id:phone_1234`

**This approach will require migrating existing tokens to add the new combined metadata field.**

## Async Reactor `callback_url` Deprecation

[Async Reactors](/docs/concepts/what-are-reactors#asynchronous-reactors) will no longer support the `callback_url` attribute and will be replaced by the [Reactor Webhooks Events](/docs/api/webhooks/eventdata#reactors).

To migrate your Async Reactors, you will need to:

1. Create a new Webhook either with our [Management API](https://developers.basistheory.com/docs/api/webhooks/api)/[Terraform Provider](https://developers.basistheory.com/docs/sdks/server-side/terraform) or in the [Portal](https://portal.basistheory.com/settings/webhooks).
 1. You may be able to use the existing URL for your rector processing
2. [Invoke a Reactor Asynchronously](/docs/api/reactors/#invoke-a-reactor-async) with the new `/reactors/:id/react-async` endpoint.
3. Once your webhook is invoked, retrieve the [Async Reactor Results](/docs/api/reactors#retrieve-result)
 1. This ensures the system receiving the webhook has access to the results of the reactor.
4. Process the results in the same way you are currently doing with the `callback_url`

To coordinate a rollout of these changes, we suggest you stop sending requests with `callback_url` and change the request path from `/react` to `/react-async` when you roll out the new webhook handler code. This will avoid any overlap or duplication of processing.

## Migrating to New Rate Limits

Learn more about these Rate Limit changes in our blog [Introducing New Rate Limits](https://blog.basistheory.com/introducing-new-rate-limits).

### Production Tenants

- Private Applications
  - You must rotate Private API keys to the new format to maintain your existing Rate Limits.
- Public and Management Applications
  - While it is suggested to rotate these keys, this is an option to change for these Applications - based on our findings, no active customers will see any reduction in service.
- Whitelabel Proxies
  - No action is required for these tenants
- Reactors
  - If your Reactor specifies an Application, you'll need to generate a new key for that application to ensure it has the correct rate limit. No other change is required.

### Test Tenants

No changes are required for Test Tenants. If you need a higher rate limit for these tenants, please contact [`support@basistheory.com`](mailto:support@basistheory.com) or your account representative.

### How to rotate your Private API keys

<b><u>Rotate via our Portal</u></b><br/>
If you created your keys via the [Portal](https://portal.basistheory.com) - follow this guide:

  1. Go to the [Applications List](https://portal.basistheory.com/applications)
  2. Find the Applications needing keys rotated and click the "edit" icon ✏️.
  3. In the Application details page, find the "API Keys" section and create a new API Key. _(Don't worry, this will not stop the existing keys from working.)_
  4. Copy the new generated key and update your systems with the new value.
  5. Once you are done updating all your systems with the new value, click the "trash" 🗑️ icon to delete the "Legacy" key. (Only do this once all usages of the keys have been updated)

<b><u>Rotate via Terraform</u></b><br/>
  You are able to manage API Keys via Terraform with the Guide found in v2 of our [Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Basis-Theory/basistheory/latest/docs/guides/v1_v2_migration).

<b><u>Rotate via API</u></b><br/>
  1. [Create a new key](https://developers.basistheory.com/docs/api/applications/application-keys#create-application-key) for the Applications
  2. Update your systems with the new key
  3. Once all systems have been updated, delete the [old key](/docs/api/applications/application-keys#delete-application-key)

## Old Rate Limit Deprecation

The existing rate limits will be deprecated in favor of new rate limits capable of being customized.

- Globale Rate Limit
  - Counter: IP
  - Rate: 1000 Requests / 10 Seconds
  - Block Duration: 10 Seconds
- Portal:
  - Counter: IP
  - Rate: 600 Requests / 10 Seconds
  - Block Duration: 10 Seconds
- API
  - POST /tokens/search
    - Counter: IP
    - Rate 50 Requests / 10 Seconds
    - Block Duration: 10 Seconds
  - GET /tokens
    - Counter: IP
    - Rate 100 Requests / 10 Seconds
    - Block Duration: 10 Seconds
  - POST (/tokens | /tokenize)
    - Counter: IP
    - Rate 200 Requests / 10 Seconds
    - Block Duration: 10 Seconds

## Application Key Regenerate Deprecation

Regenerating an application's API key used to involve calling the `Regenerate` endpoint on the Application. With the introduction of Application keys, this functionality has been replaced with the ability to create new Application Keys and remove the old key.

To recreate the Regeneration action you'll need to:

1. [Create a new Application Key](/docs/api/applications/application-keys#create-application-key)
2. [Remove the old Application Key](/docs/api/applications/application-keys#delete-application-key)

## Complex Token Search Deprecation

The token search endpoint [POST /tokens/search](/docs/api/tokens/search#search-v1) no longer supports complex Lucene queries in the `query` parameter.

### Deprecated Query Patterns

- The following token fields are no longer supported within search queries: `type`, `fingerprint`, `container`, `created_by`, `created_at`, `modified_by`, `modified_at`.
- Mixed search terms containing mixed attributes, e.g. `metadata.customer_id:1234 AND type:card`.
- Combining terms with the `OR` operator. The `AND` operator is only supported for multi-metadata search.
- Term negation is not supported.

### Supported Query Patterns

- Filtering by a single `id`, `metadata.<key>`, or `data` term
- Filtering by multiple `metadata.<key>` terms combined with an `AND` operator, e.g. `metadata.type:phone AND metadata.customer_id:1234`

## Migrating From Privacy Settings

Privacy settings were previously used to scope access to Tokens based on their data classification and impact levels.
In order to provide a more flexible access control model that can be customized per Application, we have introduced
Token [Containers](/docs/concepts/what-are-containers)
to logically group Tokens according to any data governance requirements. A Token may be explicitly added to a container
when creating the Token, or if unspecified, a Token will be placed within the container `/<classification>/<impact_level>/`
by default. If you were previously customizing a Token's classification or impact level, please update your systems to
directly set the `containers` attribute instead.

Restriction policies were previously used in conjunction with impact level based read
permissions (e.g., `token:general:read:low`) to define how Token data should be transformed when reading Tokens with
a higher impact level than your permission allows. This model proved to be too inflexible as it was a global setting
applied at the Token level and could not be customized per actor. Restriction policies no longer have any functional
impact, and were replaced by transforms applied via [Access Rules](/docs/concepts/access-controls#what-are-access-rules).

If your systems are using the `privacy` attribute of the [Token Object](/docs/api/tokens#token-object) in API responses, please
update your integration to ignore this attribute as it will be removed on February 1, 2023.

## Migrating From Reactor Formulas

Reactor Formulas were how you added code to a Reactor and configured some of its behavior.
To offer less friction when creating Reactors, we have introduced a new `code` attribute to the Reactor Object.
This attribute is a `string` containing the code that will be executed when the Reactor is triggered.

Alongside not having to create a new formula for each Reactor with different code, this new approach also removes some previous restrictions on `configuration` and `request_parameters`.
Reactors with `code` will not provide validation of the `configuration` attribute or its request parameters, so you will need to perform this validation directly in your code if necessary.

If your systems are using the `formula` attribute of the [Reactor Object](/docs/api/reactors/#reactor-object) in API responses, please update to use `code` instead.
This can be done simply by taking the value for the `code` attribute on the formula and setting it as the value for the `code` attribute on the Reactor.

Below there are some examples on how this operation can be performed by retrieving the formula object and performing a [patch operation] in the Reactor:

You can continue to use your existing Reactors with `formula` until they are removed on a future date, but we advise you to migrate to `code` as soon as possible.
Keep in mind that after migrating to `code` the `formula` will be removed from the Reactor but can still be retrieved for consulting purposes until the shutdown date.
