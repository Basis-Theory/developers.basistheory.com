# Access Rules

Access Rules are the building blocks for constructing fine-grained access control policies for an Application. When performing an operation through the Basis Theory API, Access Rules are evaluated in priority order until the first rule is found with matching container or conditions. Once a matching rule is identified, the transform defined on the rule determines if and how Token data will be returned from the API. If no matching rules are found, access to the requested resource is denied with a 403 Forbidden error.

## Access Rules Logic

Access Rules will be applied with an implicit `OR` operator. This means that if any of the rules match, the operation will be allowed. If no rules match, the operation will be denied.

Access Rule Conditions will be applied with an implicit `AND` operator. This means that all conditions must be met for the rule to match.

## Access Rule

| Attribute     | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `description` | _string_ | A description of this Access Rule                                                                                                                           |
| `priority`    | _int_    | The priority of the rule, beginning with `1` and higher values having lower precedence                                                                      |
| `container`   | _string_ | (Optional) The [container](/docs/concepts/what-are-containers) of Tokens this rule is scoped to                                                             |
| `conditions`  | _array_  | (Optional) List of [conditions](/docs/api/applications/access-rules#access-rule-conditions) to be satisfied for the rule to be used. Only apply to sessions |
| `transform`   | _string_ | The [transform](/docs/api/applications/access-rules#access-rule-transforms) to apply to accessed Tokens                                                     |
| `permissions` | _array_  | List of [permissions](/docs/api/applications/permissions#permission-types) to grant on this Access Rule                                                     |

### Access Rule Transforms

| Name   | Type     | Description                                                                                                             |
| ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Redact | `redact` | Redacts the `data` property from Token responses                                                                        |
| Mask   | `mask`   | Returns the masked value in the `data` property on Token responses if a `mask` is defined, otherwise `data` is redacted |
| Reveal | `reveal` | Returns the plaintext value in the `data` property in Token responses                                                   |

### Access Rule Conditions

| Attribute   | Type     | Description                                                                   |
| ----------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `attribute` | _string_ | The token attribute the condition is evaluated on. Either `id` or `container` |
| `operator`  | _string_ | The operator used for the evaluation. Either `starts_with` or `equals`        |
| `value`     | _string_ | The value to evaluate against the token attribute                             |
