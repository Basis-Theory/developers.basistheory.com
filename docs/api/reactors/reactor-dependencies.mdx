## List of available dependencies

This is a list of the dependencies that are available to use in Reactors. You'll need to `require` the module name in "Require in Reactors" below to import the corresponding package. For example, using `require('@basis-theory/node-sdk-2')` to import `@basis-theory/node-sdk` module.
