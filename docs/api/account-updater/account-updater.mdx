# Account Updater <Enterprise />

<Alert type={Alerts.INFO}>Account Updater is an Enterprise feature. Contact <a href="mailto:support@basistheory.com">support@basistheory.com</a> to request access.</Alert>

Basis Theory supports merchants who leverage [card-on-file transactions](https://blog.basistheory.com/card-on-file-transactions) or [subscription](https://blog.basistheory.com/subscription-payment-processing) billing models by allowing payment card data to be collected and securely vaulted for future transactions. However, vaulted card details can become outdated when cards are re-issued due to card expiration, account closures, lost or stolen cards, or fraud prevention. This can result in failed transactions and billing disruptions, leading to involuntary customer churn or lost revenue. Account Updater enables you to keep vaulted card tokens up to date with the latest information from the card networks, improving transaction success rates.

Each request to update a batch of cards is referred to as an Account Updater Job. Job requests and results are transmitted using CSV-formatted flat files containing Basis Theory tokens. Jobs are submitted in a 2-step process - first, [create an account updater job](#create-account-updater-job) and receive an upload URL in the response, then [upload your request CSV file](#upload-request-file) directly through the upload URL. Once all updates have been received from the card networks and the job has been completed, you will receive a webhook reporting the overall job status. If successful, the job's result details can be [downloaded](#download-result-file) in CSV format, which you can use to update token id references in your system.

Basis Theory currently supports updating `card` tokens against the Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover networks.

## Create Account Updater Job

Creates an Account Updater Job to update a batch of `card` tokens. Responds with an [Account Updater Job](#account-updater-job) including an `upload_url` to submit a request CSV file for processing.

<HttpMethod
  method={HttpMethods.POST}
  endpoint="https://api.basistheory.com/account-updater/jobs"
/>

### Permissions
<Permission content="account-updater:job:create" />

### Expiration

You have one hour to upload a request file, at which time the job and upload url will expire and the job will be removed. Attempting to retrieve an expired job will result in a `404` status code. If a job expires, simply start the process again by creating a new job.

## Upload Request File

Once you have created a [Request CSV File](#request-file-format), you can use the `upload_url` for the Job to submit your file for processing. You can use the `upload_url` to upload your file using any usage patterns supported by [S3 pre-signed URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html).

<Alert> The maximum upload file size is 30 MB per file (approx. 300k tokens)</Alert>
