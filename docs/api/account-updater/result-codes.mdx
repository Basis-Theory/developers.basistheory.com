## Result Code Categories

Result codes are grouped into categories using a standard prefix, and are formatted as `<CATEGORY>_`.
You can use the category prefix when troubleshooting to quickly identify whether any action is required on your part.

| Prefix | Category Description                                                                                        |

| `UPD`  | A update was received from the network; update your records with the updated token.                         |
| `WRN`  | The token was correctly processed, although it did not result in an update. Action is potentially required. |
| `ERR`  | An error occurred while processing the file or token, requiring action.                                     |
