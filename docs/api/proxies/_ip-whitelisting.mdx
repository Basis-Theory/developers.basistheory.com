### IP Whitelisting

Some 3rd party services may require whitelisting of Basis Theory IP addresses to allow communication.
You can find our IP list [here](/docs/api/ip-addresses).

<Alert>We can also support single dedicated outbound IP addresses. Please <a href="https://basistheory.com/contact">reach out</a> to our support team if you have specific security requirements that mandate this configuration.</Alert>
