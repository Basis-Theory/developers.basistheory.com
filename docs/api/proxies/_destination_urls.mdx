### Destination URLs

The configured destination URL must use HTTPS with DNS as the host (explicit IP addresses are not allowed). Destinations must use HTTPS >= TLSv1.2.

The destination URL will serve as the base URL for the proxied request, and any path and/or query parameters on your request path (`/proxy/**`) will be appended to the base URL before forwarding the request.

For example, sending a proxy request to `https://api.basistheory.com/proxy/foo/bar?param=value` and including the header `BT-PROXY-URL=https://example.com/api` will result in the request being forwarded to `https://example.com/api/foo/bar?param=value`.

<Alert>The Proxy removes trailing slashes from the destination URL to ensure proper concatenation of contents following <code>/proxy</code>.</Alert>

<Alert type="warning">If the destination endpoint takes more than 25 seconds to respond, a <code>408 Request Timeout</code> error will be returned.</Alert>
