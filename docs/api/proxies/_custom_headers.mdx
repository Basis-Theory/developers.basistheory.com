| `BT-PROXY-DESTINATION-STATUS` | This header contains the HTTP status code from the destination server. |

<Alert>If the <code>BT-PROXY-DESTINATION-STATUS</code> HTTP header is present and has an HTTP status code, the code represents the status code responded from the destination service. A 4xx code generally points to a problem with the integration to the destination, while a 5xx code suggests an issue with the destination service itself.<br /><br />If the <code>BT-PROXY-DESTINATION-STATUS</code> HTTP header is not present, there is likely an integration or service problem. 4xx codes indicate issues on your end, while 5xx codes indicate problems with Basis Theory's service.</Alert>
