# Rate Limits

The Basis Theory API has rate limits applied to ensure the speed and consistency of our systems.

### Reactors

Applicable to [invoking Reactors](/docs/api/reactors/#invoke-a-reactor) or [invoking Pre-Configured Proxies](/docs/api/proxies/pre-configured-proxies#invoke-a-proxy) with a Request or Response Transform.

| Limit        | Note                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Code length   | The maximum code length accepted by a Reactor is 50K chars. |
| Payload Size  | The maximum payload size to invoke a Reactor is 5 MB. <a href="https://basistheory.com/contact">Please reach out</a> if your use case requires more than that. |
| Concurrency   | The default hot concurrency is set to 1 by default, this will fan out and cold start additional Reactors if multiple requests hapeen concurrently. If you need additional hot concurrency, <a href="https://basistheory.com/contact">please reach out</a>.                                                                                                                                               |
| Synchronous Timeout   | Synchronous Reactor Invoke calls will timeout after 30s.
