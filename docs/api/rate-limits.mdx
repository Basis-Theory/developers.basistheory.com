## Default Rate Limits

The Basis Theory API has rate limits applied to ensure the speed and consistency of our systems. Rate Limits will always apply to the lowest Rate available for a given request. For example, if a request is made to `POST /tokens` with on a `Test Tenant` the rate limit for that request is `50 Requests / 10 Seconds`.

### Tenant Type Rate Limits

#### Test Tenant

| -------- | -------- | ------- | ---- | ------ |
| ANY | ANY      | IP and API Key      | 50 req / 10 s | Throttle |

### API Resource Rate Limits
| Resource | Counter | Rate | Action |
| -------- | ------- | ---- | ------ |
| POST /tokens/search | API Key AND IP | 50 req / 10 s | Throttle |
| GET /tokens | API Key AND IP | 100 req / 10 s | Throttle |
| POST /tokens OR /tokenize | API Key AND IP | 200 req / 10 s | Throttle |

## Legacy Rate Limits

### Legacy API Keys

## Other Limits

### Default Quotas
Quotas are Tenant specific limits that can be adjusted by Basis Theory. Below are some of the default Quota's applied to all tenants as they are created - to find the full list of Quota' or to request a change, please visit your tenant's [Quota page](https://portal.basistheory.com/settings?tab=quotas).

### Reactors

Applicable to [invoking Reactors](/docs/api/reactors/#invoke-a-reactor) or [invoking Pre-Configured Proxies](/docs/api/proxies/pre-configured-proxies#invoke-a-proxy) with a Request or Response Transform.

| Limit        | Note                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Code length   | The maximum code length accepted by a Reactor is 50K chars. |
| Payload Size  | The maximum payload size to invoke a Reactor is 1 MB. <a href="https://basistheory.com/contact">Please reach out</a> if your use case requires more than that. |
| Concurrency   | The default hot concurrency is set to 1 by default, this will fan out and cold start additional Reactors if multiple requests happen concurrently. If you need additional hot concurrency, <a href="https://basistheory.com/contact">please reach out</a>.                                                                                                                                               |
