## Rate Limits

The Basis Theory API has rate limits applied to ensure the speed and consistency of our systems. Rate Limits will always apply to the lowest Rate available for a given request. For example, if a request is made to `POST /tokens` with on a `Test Tenant` the rate limit for that request is `50 Requests / 10 Seconds`.

### Tenant Type Rate Limits

#### Test Tenant
| Method | Resource | Counter | Rate | Action |
| -------- | -------- | ------- | ---- | ------ |
| ANY | ANY      | IP and API Key      | 50 req / 10 s | Throttle |

### API Resource Rate Limits

| Resource | Counter | Rate | Action |
| -------- | ------- | ---- | ------ |
| POST /tokens/search | IP | 50 req / 10 s | 10s Block |
| GET /tokens | IP | 100 req / 10 s | 10s Block |
| POST /tokens OR /tokenize | IP | 200 req / 10 s | 10s Block |
| ANY /account-updater/* | IP | 10 req / 10 s | Throttle |

### Application Type Rate Limits

#### Private Application
| Resource | Counter | Rate | Action |
| -------- | ------- | ---- | ------ |
| ANY      | API Key      | 1000 req / 10 s | 10s Block |

#### Public Application
| Resource | Counter | Rate | Action |
| -------- | ------- | ---- | ------ |

| Code length   | The maximum code length accepted by a Reactor is 50K chars. |
| Payload Size  | The maximum payload size to invoke a Reactor is 1 MB. <a href="https://basistheory.com/contact">Please reach out</a> if your use case requires more than that. |
| Concurrency   | The default hot concurrency is set to 1 by default, this will fan out and cold start additional Reactors if multiple requests happen concurrently.
