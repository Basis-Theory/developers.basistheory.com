## Default Rate Limits

The Basis Theory API has rate limits applied to ensure the speed and consistency of our systems. Rate Limits will always apply to the lowest Rate available for a given request. For example, if a request is made to `POST /tokens` with on a `Test Tenant` the rate limit for that request is `50 Requests / 10 Seconds`.

### Tenant Type Rate Limits

#### Test Tenant
| Method | Resource | Counter | Rate | Action |
| -------- | -------- | ------- | ---- | ------ |
| ANY | ANY      | IP and API Key      | 50 req / 10 s | Throttle |

### API Resource Rate Limits
| Resource | Counter | Rate | Action |
| -------- | ------- | ---- | ------ |
| POST /tokens/search | IP | 50 req / 10 s | 10s Block |
| GET /tokens | IP | 100 req / 10 s | 10s Block |
| POST /tokens OR /tokenize | IP | 200 req / 10 s | 10s Block |
| ANY /account-updater/* | IP | 10 req / 10 s | Throttle |

### Application Type Rate Limits

#### Private Application
| Resource | Counter | Rate | Action |
| -------- | ------- | ---- | ------ |

### Proxies

#### Unauthenticated / Whitelabel Proxies

| Method | Resource | Counter | Rate | Action |
| -------- | -------- | ------- | ---- | ------ |
| ANY | ANY      | IP and API Key      | 100 req / 1 m | Block |

## Error Codes

## Other Limits

| Limit        | Note                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Code length   | The maximum code length accepted by a Reactor is 50K chars. |
| Payload Size  | The maximum payload size to invoke a Reactor is 1 MB. <a href="https://basistheory.com/contact">Please reach out</a> if your use case requires more than that. |
| Concurrency   | The default hot concurrency is set to 1 by default, this will fan out and cold start additional Reactors if multiple requests happen concurrently.
