# Enrichments

Basis Theory offers several features that can be used to enrich the tokens that are tokenized. The following enrichments, when activated, can be found within the `enrichments` property of a [Token](/docs/api/tokens/#token-object).

| Attribute     | Type     | Token Types                                                                                    | Description                                                        |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `bin_details` | _object_ | [`card`](/docs/api/tokens/token-types#card) , [`card_number`](/docs/api/tokens/token-types#card) | Object containing information related to the tokenized credit card |

## Using Token Enrichments

When a specific Enrichment is activated for a Tenant, each is added as a token property and returned during every [token operation](/docs/api/tokens/) and is available to be used within [Detokenization Expressions](/docs/expressions/detokenization#using-token-properties).

## BIN Details <Enterprise /> \{#bin-details}

BIN details, or Bank Identification Number details, represent a fundamental aspect of credit card processing.
Each credit card is associated with a unique BIN, which serves as a numerical identifier for the issuing bank
or financial institution. These details hold crucial technical significance as they help validate transactions,
prevent fraud, and optimize routing. Understanding the intricate mechanics of BIN details
is vital for implementing secure and efficient credit card processing solutions.

Basis Theory offers two options for enriching `card` or `card_number` tokens with BIN details, depending on the level of detail you require:

| Level                      | Description                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Standard](#standard-data) | Basic information about the credit card's function and origin.                                |
| [Enhanced](#enhanced-data) | Includes Standard Data and also interchange, authentication, and other more advanced details. |
