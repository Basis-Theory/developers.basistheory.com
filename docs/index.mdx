## What is Basis Theory?

Our software becomes a core part of your infrastructure enabling you to quickly encrypt, tokenize, and store any payload securely. Your token infrastructure can be used to protect data at rest, as it passes between your own internal systems, or how it's permissioned and shared with third parties.

### 1. Set up your Test Account

Head over to the Basis Theory Portal and create a [Personal Account](/docs/concepts/access-controls#basis-theory-account) using your work email (e.g., _john.doe@<span>yourcompany.com</span>_)

<AuthButtons />

In the Portal's Welcome Page, create a [TEST Tenant](/docs/concepts/access-controls#what-are-tenants) - the place where your tokens and other resources are stored:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
