# Production Checklist

## Overview

An interactive guide to help you learn best practices before going to Production with your Basis Theory integration.

The answers are persistent to the browser (local storage), and can be reset by clearing website data. Incognito windows can also be used to start a new questionnaire.

## Account

<QuestionCard question="Did you create your account using a business e-mail?">
  <Content type="no">
    <Alert type="warning">Create a new account using your business e-mail. Favor using a shared engineering email account (e.g. platform@mycompany.com).</Alert>
  </Content>
</QuestionCard>
