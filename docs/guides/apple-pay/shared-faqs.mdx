### My Stripe PaymentIntent and SetupIntent fail when using ApplePay.

For PaymentIntents, the `currency` for the ApplePay Session and the `currency` set in the PaymentIntent must match or Stripe will decline the transaction.
For SetupIntents, the `currency` for the ApplePay Session must match the defualt `currency` of your account - SetupIntents do not allow `currency` to be overridden.
