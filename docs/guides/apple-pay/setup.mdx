# Apple Pay Setup

Before you can accept Apple Pay in your e-commerce or platform, you have to complete Apple's Merchant setup. While the detailed steps can be found in [Apple Pay official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applepaywebmerchantregistrationapi/registering_with_apple_pay_and_applying_to_use_the_api), we will cover them in a hands-on approach to streamline the integration process.

## Apple Developer Program Enrollment

An active subscription to [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) is a requirement to accept Apple Pay in your application.

Usually, the steps are straightforward and self-explanatory. You just have visit [this link](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/) and follow the instructions in the page.

However, some users may face this error and get stuck in a loop:

There can be many reasons for such. If Apple portal doesn't give further details, your best option is to [contact support](https://developer.apple.com/contact/) and report the issue.

Support staff may ask for additional verification, such as sending personal documents through Apple's portal to verify identify and unblock the process. This sort of request can happen via e-mail, even after completing the purchase, in order to complete enrollment.

## Create a Merchant ID

After the enrollment is complete, developers can create Merchant IDs in [Apple's portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/add/merchant).
Requirements are minimal:

The identifier **can't** be changed later.

Existing Merchant IDs can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/merchant).

## Create a Payment Processing Certificate

Find your Merchant ID in the [Merchant List](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/merchant) and navigate to its detail page.

In the **Apple Pay Payment Processing Certificate** section, click _Create Certificate_ to be directed to the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) upload page.

To create a new CSR we will use [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/):

<Tabs className="bt-tabs" queryString="encryption">
  <TabItem value="ec" label="Elliptic Curve">

```bash
# First create a new private key
openssl ecparam -out apple_pay_private.key -name prime256v1 -genkey

# Then, source the private key to create a new CSR:
openssl req -new -sha256 -key apple_pay_private.key -nodes -out apple_pay.csr -subj '/O=Basis Theory Solutions/C=US'
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rsa" label="RSA (China only)">

```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout apple_pay_private.key -out apple_pay.csr -nodes -subj '/O=Company/C=US'
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Update the `subj` param to match your company information. For example:

 ```text
-subj "/CN=EnchantedWidgets, Inc./O=EnchantedWidgets, Inc./OU=Product Development/CN=John Doe/UID=johndoe/EMAIL=johndoe@example.com/STREET=123 Fantasy Lane/L=Fairyville/ST=Fairyland/C=FL/POSTALCODE=12345/DC=fantasy/DC=local"
```

Upload the `apple_pay.csr` file in Apple portal to create a new Certificate.

Download the `apple_pay.cer` file and convert it to PEM format, for later usage:

```bash
openssl x509 -inform der -in apple_pay.cer -out apple_pay.pem
```
