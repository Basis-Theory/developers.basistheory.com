Letâ€™s begin by reviewing the Apple Pay payment flow.

When the user clicks the Apple "Pay" button, a sequence of high-level steps is initiated:

1. **Creation of an Apple Pay session** - The client application calls Basis Theory to initiate an Apple Pay session.

2. **Decryption of the payment data** - After the user authorizes the payment, the encrypted payment data is sent to Basis Theory for decryption and storage.
   Basis Theory responds with an [Apple Pay](/docs/api/apple-pay/api) Token that can be used to process the payment.

3. **Processing of the payment data** - The Basis Theory Apple Pay Token is forwarded to the payment processor via Basis Theory Proxy, which translates Token back to raw data before sending the request.
   Upon receiving a successful payment response, the client application can complete the payment and inform the user that the payment was successful.
