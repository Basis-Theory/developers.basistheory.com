# Apple Pay Go Live

This checklist will guide you through the critical steps you need to follow before moving your Apple Pay integration into production. Ensuring that everything is properly set up and tested reduces the likelihood of errors during live transactions and offers a seamless payment experience to your customers.

---

## 1. Test in Production with a Live Wallet and Card

- Before going live, perform test transactions using a **Live Apple Pay wallet** with a personal or corporate card added. This step ensures that everything is functioning correctly in the production environment with real-world payment methods.
- Keep in mind that Apple Pay in production does not behave the same as in testing, so using live payment information is critical.

## 2. Handling Transaction Failures

When a transaction fails, here’s what you should do:

1. **Check the Error Code**:
   - Look for any error codes returned as part of the failed transaction response. These error codes typically point to the cause of the failure.

2. **Contact Your Payment Processor**:
   - If the error code is unclear, reach out to your **Payment Processor** to diagnose the issue. As processors handle the transaction flow, they often have the most accurate and actionable information about why a transaction may have failed.

3. **Seek Assistance from Basis Theory (if applicable)**:
   - If your integration leverages Basis Theory and you’re unable to resolve the issue with your processor, Basis Theory support can assist in identifying potential issues. However, the **Processor** will usually have the best resources and tools to help address errors swiftly.

## 3. Determine Where to Send Apple Pay Token Payloads

Apple Pay generates a secure token payload for each transaction. It’s essential to configure your integration properly to ensure these tokens are correctly routed. Follow these steps:

1. **Review Processor Documentation**:
   - Check the integration and setup documentation provided by your **Payment Processor** (PSP). They often provide detailed instructions on how and where to send Apple Pay token payloads.

2. **Enable Apple Pay Support with Your PSP**:
   - Some payment processors require you to explicitly enable Apple Pay within their systems. Reach out to your PSP to ensure Apple Pay functionality is activated for your account.

3. **Understand How to Send Tokens**:
   - Each PSP handles Apple Pay tokens differently, so it is critical to:
     - Verify where the token payloads should be sent.
     - Confirm the API endpoints, required headers, and payload formats specific to your PSP.

4. **Contact PSP for Guidance**:
   - If the documentation is unclear, **reach out to your PSP’s support team** to clarify:
     - The process for enabling Apple Pay support.
     - Steps to correctly transmit the token payload for processing.

## Final Notes

- Keep logs of your test transactions in production for future reference.
- Double-check all API keys, certificates, and environment configurations to avoid common production issues.
- If you encounter additional issues or have questions specific to Basis Theory functionality, don’t hesitate to contact Basis Theory’s support team for further assistance.

By following this checklist, you’ll be prepared to seamlessly integrate and go live with Apple Pay, providing a secure and smooth payment experience for your users.
