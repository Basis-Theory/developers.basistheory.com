# Accept Apple Pay™ MPAN Payments

This guide explains how to accept Apple Pay™ payments using Merchant-Provisioned Account Numbers (MPANs) with the Basis Theory platform to handle PCI-sensitive data securely. MPANs are specialized tokens provided by Apple that enable merchants to accept payments for recurring transactions, subscriptions, and other ongoing payment scenarios.

<PaymentFlow />

## Understanding Apple Pay™ MPANs

Apple provides MPAN tokens for various payment scenarios:
- **Recurring Payments** - Subscriptions, memberships, and regular billing cycles
- **Automatic Reload** - Topping up accounts when balances fall below thresholds
- **Deferred Payment** - Pre-authorization for services delivered at a later date

When using MPANs, the payment flow includes additional configuration in the Apple Pay™ payment request to specify the type of recurring payment and associated parameters.

<GettingStartedSection/>

<DomainVerificationGuide/>

<CreateApplePaySession />

MPANs require an additional configuration passed into the Apple Pay™ment session.
Below are example ApplePaySessions for the various types of MPANs.

Each object has slightly different attributes.
However, there are two that are shared, `managementURL` and `tokenNotificationURL`.

The `managementURL` attribute should be a URL to a webpage on your site where the user can manage their recurring payments.

The `tokenNotificationURL` is the URL that Apple will call with events that affect the created MPAN.
Basis Theory will be responsible for receiving the events from Apple and updating the token.
This URL should be in format of `https://api.basistheory.com/apple-pay/{<YOUR_TENANT_ID>}`.

#### Recurring Payment (Subscription)

```javascript
function createApplePaySession() {
  return new ApplePaySession(3, {
    "countryCode": "US",
    "currencyCode": "USD",
    "merchantCapabilities": [
      "supports3DS"
    ],
    "supportedNetworks": [
      "visa",
      "masterCard",
      "amex",
      "discover"
    ],
    "total": {
      "label": "Monthly Subscription",
      "type": "final",
      "amount": "9.99"
    },
    // highlight-start
    "recurringPaymentRequest": {
      "paymentDescription": "Monthly Premium Subscription",
      "regularBilling": {

        "type": "final"
      },
      "managementURL": "https://yoursite.com/manage-subscription",
      "tokenNotificationURL": "https://api.basistheory.com/apple-pay/{tenantId}"

#### Automatic Reload

```javascript
function createApplePaySession() {
  return new ApplePaySession(3, {

    "currencyCode": "USD",
    "merchantCapabilities": ["supports3DS"],
    "supportedNetworks": ["visa", "masterCard", "amex", "discover"],

  });
}
```

#### Deferred Payment

```javascript
function createApplePaySession() {
  return new ApplePaySession(3, {
    "countryCode": "US",
    "currencyCode": "USD",
    "merchantCapabilities": ["supports3DS"],
    "supportedNetworks": ["visa", "masterCard", "amex", "discover"],

<Faqs />

### What's the difference between regular DPAN and MPAN tokens?

MPANs are merchant-provisioned tokens that offer enhanced security and specific use cases like recurring payments.
They have different lifecycle management requirements and may include additional metadata.

### Do all payment processors support MPANs?

Not all payment processors support MPAN processing.
Check with your PSP to ensure they can handle merchant-provisioned Apple Pay™ tokens before implementing MPAN support.

### Do all card providers suppoert MPANs?

No. Not all cards processors will supply MPANs.
However, nothing changes in the tokenization or payment flows when a card does not support MPANs.

### Can I use MPANs for one-time payments?

While MPANs are designed primarily for recurring scenarios, they can be used for one-time payments if your merchant configuration and payment processor support it.

### How do I handle MPAN token updates?

Basis Theroy will handle the webhooks received from Apple and update your MPAN tokens accordingly.
