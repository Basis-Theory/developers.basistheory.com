### Domain Verification

Domain verification is a key step in getting Apple Pay™ up and running on your site. It is a required step for development and production servers, to confirm that you own the domain where Apple Pay™ will be implemented, preventing unauthorized use and maintaining the integrity of the payment system.

1. Download and serve the [domain association file](https://cdn.basistheory.com/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association) on your server at `https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association`.
2. Add the public domain to your tenant using the [Customer Portal](https://portal.basistheory.com/settings?tab=apple+pay) or the [API](/docs/api/apple-pay/api#register-domain-address)

<Alert type={Alerts.INFO}>
  Apple requires the website to be served via HTTPS, which can be tricky during the development phase. Tunneling may represent a good option to preview local projects through a working HTTPS connection. [Cloudflare tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/how-to/preview-with-cloudflare-tunnel/) may be worth checking out.
