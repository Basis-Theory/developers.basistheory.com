# Taking 3DS Live

his guide provides all the information you need to begin processing real 3DS transactions in a production environment.
It includes essential steps, best practices, and troubleshooting tips to ensure a smooth 3DS implementation, reducing fraud while maintaining a frictionless customer experience.

## Using 3DS Results with Popular PSPs
Basis Theory provides PSP-agnostic 3DS transaction data. According to their documentation, each payment service provider (PSP) handles "External 3DS" data differently.

The best resource for utilizing 3rd Party 3DS authentication values with a PSP is to contact them directly or review their documentation. Below are a few common examples of how to map the Basis Theory 3DS authentication values to populate PSP requests.

### Adyen
External 3DS data can be passed for Adyen's `/authorise` request.

#### Sample Payload
```json
{
  // ...
  "mpiData" : {
    "cavv": authentication.authentication_value,
    "eci": authentication.eci,
    "dsTransId": authentication.ds_transaction_id,
    "directoryResponse": authentication.directory_status_code,
    "authenticationResponse": authentication.authentication_status_code,
    "threeDSVersion": authentication.threeds_version,
    "challengeCancel": authentication.challenge_cancel_reason_code,
    // ...
  },
  "threeDS2RequestData": {
    "threeDSRequestorChallengeInd": authentication.challenge_preference_code,
  },
  // ...
}
```

#### Property Mapping
| Adyen Value | Basis Theory 3DS Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `paymentMethod.type` | - | Specific to Adyen flow, refer to Adyen's documentation. |
| `mpiData.authenticationResponse` | `authentication.authentication_status_code` | - |
| `mpiData.directoryResponse` | `authentication.directory_status_code` | - |
| `mpiData.cavv` | `authentication.authentication_value` | - |
| `mpiData.dsTransID` | `authentication.ds_transaction_id` | - |
| `mpiData.eci` | `authentication.eci` | - |
| `mpiData.threeDSVersion` | `authentication.threeds_version` | - |
| `threeDS2RequestData.threeDSRequestorChallengeInd` | `authentication.challenge_preference_code` | - |
| `mpiData.cavvAlgorithm` | - | Applies only to Cartes Bancaires on 3DS v1. 3DS v1 is unsupported by Basis Theory. |
| `mpiData.challengeCancel`  | `authentication.challenge_cancel_reason_code` | - |
| `mpiData.riskScore`  | `authentication.message_extensions[X].data` | Applies only to Cartes Bancaires. Data would be on unspecified message extension. |

| `additionalData.scaExemption` | - | Applies only to Cartes Bancaires. Specific to Adyen flow, refer to Adyen's [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/Checkout/latest/post/payments#request-additionalData-AdditionalData3DSecure-scaExemption). |
| `shopperInteraction` | - | Specific to Adyen flow, refer to Adyen's [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/Checkout/latest/post/payments#request-shopperInteraction). |
| `recurringProcessingModel` | - | Specific to Adyen flow, refer to Adyen's [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/Checkout/latest/post/payments#request-recurringProcessingModel). |

### Stripe

External 3DS data can be added as part of a Stripe `PaymentIntent` or `SetupIntent`.

#### Sample Payload
This example payload shows how you can pass a `payment_method_options` property into both Payment Intents and Setup Intents and how this may be implemented; if you have questions, the best place to start is the [Stripe Official Documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/three-d-secure-import).
```json
{
  //...
  "payment_method_options": {
    "card": {
      //...
      "three_d_secure": {
        "cryptogram": authentication.authentication_value,
        "transaction_id": authentication.ds_transaction_id,
        "version": authentication.threeds_version,
        "ares_trans_status": authentication.authentication_status_code,
        "electronic_commerce_indicator": authentication.eci,
        "exemption_indicator": null,
        "requestor_challenge_indicator": authentication.challenge_preference_code,
      }
    }
  }
}
```
#### Property Mapping

| Stripe Value | Basis Theory 3DS Value | Observations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `three_d_secure.cryptogram` | `authentication.authentication_value` | - |
| `three_d_secure.transaction_id` | `authentication.ds_transaction_id` | - |
| `three_d_secure.version` | `authentication.threeds_version` | - |
| `three_d_secure.ares_trans_status` | `authentication.authentication_status_code` | - |
| `three_d_secure.electronic_commerce_indicator` | `authentication.eci` | - |
| `three_d_secure.exemption_indicator` | - | Specific to Stripe's flow, refer to Stripe's [documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_options-card-three_d_secure-exemption_indicator). |
| `three_d_secure.network_options` | See [Stripe 3DS Network Options](#network-options) table below. | - |
| `three_d_secure.requestor_challenge_indicator` | `challenge_preference_code` | - |

##### Stripe 3DS Network Options

| Stripe Value | Basis Theory 3DS Value | Observations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cartes_bancaires.cb_avalgo` | `authentication.message_extensions[X].data` | Check `authentication.message_extensions` array for `message_extensions[X].name == **CB-AVALGO**` for the value of `X` (index). |
| `cartes_bancaires.cb_exemption` | `authentication.message_extensions[X].data` | Check `authentication.message_extensions` array for `message_extensions[X].name == **CB-EXEMPTION**` for the value of `X` (index). |
| `cartes_bancaires.cb_score` | `authentication.message_extensions[X].data` | Check `authentication.message_extensions` array for `message_extensions[X].name == **CB-SCORE**` for the value of `X` (index). |

`message_extensions` is an array that could have `X` number of extensions in any given order. The best course is to go through the array and look for the `name`s of the extensions you're looking for.

### Checkout.com

#### Sample Payload

This example payload shows you this may be implemented; if you have questions, the best place to start is the [Checkout Official Documentation](https://api-reference.checkout.com/#operation/requestAPaymentOrPayout) (select “Third-party authentication” under the `3ds` object)

```json
{
  //...
  "3ds": {
    "enabled": true,
    "cryptogram": authentication.authentication_value,
    "eci": authentication.eci,
    "version": authentication.threeds_version,
    "xid": authentication.ds_transaction_id,
    "status": authentication.authentication_status_code,
    "status_reason_code": authentication.authentication_status_reason_code

## Analyzing 3DS Authentications

Basis Theory enables the Merchant to store all details surrounding their 3DS authentications.

A merchant should consider storing all the properties and values returned from the Basis Theory 3DS Session to enable their ability to better understand details and specifics about their 3DS scenarios.

If details about past authentications weren't previously stored, they can be retrieved at any time using the [Get Session](https://developers.basistheory.com/docs/api/3ds/sessions#get-a-session) endpoint.

*If you need specific analytics or help, please get in touch with <a href="mailto:support@basistheory.com">support@basistheory.com</a>.*

## Optimizing 3DS

3DS has many complicated rules, which can vary depending on the issuer you're connecting to, affecting your ability to achieve frictionless authentication, liability shift, or authenticate period successfully.
Below are a few rules of thumb you should consider when optimizing for the above scenarios.

### Additional Information

In our 3DS Implementation guides, we've suggested the bare minimum options you should consider sending within the [Merchant Info](https://developers.basistheory.com/docs/api/3ds/sessions#merchant-info-object) object and [Cardholder Info](https://developers.basistheory.com/docs/api/3ds/sessions#cardholder-info-object) during Authentication.

The general rule of thumb is that the more data you send for these, the better chance of success for frictionless and liability shift you will have with the issuers.

## Taking 3DS Live FAQs

### What versions of 3DS does the Basis Theory 3DS support?

Basis Theory supports 3DS v2.20 and 3DS v2.1.0

### What card brands/networks can be used with Basis Theory 3DS?

Visa, Mastercard/Maestro, American Express, Discover, JCB, UnionPay, Cartes Bancaires

### My transactions keep failing with a 403 status - what could be wrong?

A 403 error often indicates issues with your `merchant_info` fields, specifically an incorrect or unrecognized `mid` or `acquirer_bin` passed on the `authenticate` request.

Double-check these values with your PSP to ensure they’re set correctly and valid.

### My PSP mentions a `xid` field, but I don't see it in the Basis Theory 3DS responses.

The `xid` field was part of the older 3DS v1 specification, which Basis Theory does not support.

In most scenarios, you can safely rely on the `ds_transaction_id` in the authentication as the value for `xid`. If you still need more information, confirm with your PSP how they handle 3DS v2 fields.

### Can I use merchant information (MID, Acquirer BIN, etc.) from one PSP/acquirer for 3DS with another PSP/acquirer?

Although this may be technically feasible, it is generally not recommended.

Issuers may reject the transaction or dispute liability shifts if the merchant information used in authentication does not match the details provided during authorization.

### Can I retry a declined transaction using the same authentication value (CAVV)?

Yes, as long as the transaction details are unchanged, you can reuse the same 3DS authentication value for a short validity window (often up to 30 days).

However, confirm this with your PSP and card network to ensure compliance with their policies.
