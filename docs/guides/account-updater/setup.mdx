# Account Updater Setup

## Test Tenant Onboarding

Account Updater is an Enterprise feature and is disabled within test tenants by default.
Access can be requested from your test tenant in the Basis Theory Portal under <a href="https://portal.basistheory.com/settings?tab=quotas" target="_blank">Settings/Quotas</a>.

Once enabled, your test tenant will be configured to use the Account Updater sandbox, providing stubbed responses without forwarding requests to card networks.
See [Account Updater Testing](/docs/api/account-updater/testing) for more information.

## Production Tenant Onboarding

Account Updater access can be requested from your production tenant in the Basis Theory Portal under <a href="https://portal.basistheory.com/settings?tab=quotas" target="_blank">Settings/Quotas</a>.
Once requested, Basis Theory will reach out to complete the onboarding process and to gather the necessary merchant configuration.

You can begin preparing for this process by having the following business information ready:
- **Business Registration Number (BRN)**: Your business's government-issued registration number.
- **Merchant Descriptor**: The name that appears on customer statements.
- **Business MCC**: Merchant Category Code representing your business type.

and by collecting the following card network information from your acquirer:
- **Acquirer Identifier**: Identifier used by your acquiring bank for processing transactions.
- **Card Acceptor ID (CAID)**: Unique ID assigned to your business by the card networks.
- **Discover MID**: Merchant ID for Discover transactions (only required for Batch Account Updater).
- **Amex Establishment/SE Number**: Specific identifier for American Express transactions (only required for Batch Account Updater).

## Tenant Configuration

The following configuration applies to both test and production tenants after onboarding is completed.

### Application Setup

Create a **Private Application** for your backend system to perform Account Updater operations within your tenant.

#### Batch Permissions

- `account-updater:job:create`
- `account-updater:job:read`

[Click here](https://portal.basistheory.com/applications/create?type=private&permissions=account-updater%3Ajob%3Acreate&permissions=account-updater%3Ajob%3Aread&name=Batch+Account+Updater) to create a Private Application for use with Batch Account Updater.

#### Real-Time Permissions

- `account-updater:real-time:invoke`

### Webhook Configuration

You can configure a [webhook endpoint](/docs/api/webhooks) to receive notifications for batch job status changes.

Use the [webhook management API](/docs/api/webhooks/api/#create-webhook) to register the url for an endpoint to receive events for one or more of the following Account Updater event types:

- [account-updater.job.created](/docs/api/webhooks/eventdata#job-created)
- [account-updater.job.completed](/docs/api/webhooks/eventdata#job-completed)
- [account-updater.job.failed](/docs/api/webhooks/eventdata#job-failed)
