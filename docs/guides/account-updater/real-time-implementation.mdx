# Real-Time Implementation

This guide provides an overview of how to implement Real-Time Account Updater. It covers the initial setup, how to request an update, and how to process the results.

## Initial Setup

First, ensure that you have completed the [Account Updater Setup](/docs/guides/account-updater/setup) guide. This step is only required once.

### Private Application

<ApplicationSection type="private" permissions={["account-updater:real-time:invoke"]} />

## Request Real-Time Update

Given a vaulted `card` token that you wish to update, first identify whether your system persists the expiration date within the `card` token.
If not persisted in the token, you will need to provide the `expiration_month` and `expiration_year` parameters in the update request.

Submit a request for a [real-time update](/docs/api/account-updater/real-time#real-time-update) through the API or an SDK using the API key for the application created above.

<Tabs className="bt-tabs" groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="request" label="Request">
    ```shell showLineNumbers
    curl "https://api.basistheory.com/account-updater/real-time" \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'BT-API-KEY: ...' \
      -X POST \
      -d '{
        "token_id": "b4b89606-794a-4652-b375-f4e1d717a5db"
      }'
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="response" label="Response">
    ```json showLineNumbers
    {
      "new_token": {
        "id": "c06d0789-0a38-40be-b7cc-c28a718f76f1",
        "tenant_id": "77cb0024-123e-41a8-8ff8-a3d5a0fa8a08",
        "type": "card",
        "card": {
          "bin": "42424242",
          "last4": "4242",
          ...
        },
        ...
      },
      "result_code": "UPD_PAN"
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Process the Result

The API [response](/docs/api/account-updater/real-time#response) will include a [result_code](/docs/api/account-updater/result-codes) that indicates the outcome of the update request.
Note that some warning-level result codes may require additional action on your part.

If an update was received, the response will contain the `new_card` field containing a [token](/docs/api/tokens/#token-object).
The token references in your system should be updated accordingly, and this new token should be used for future transactions.
You have the option to retain the old token that was replaced or [delete it](/docs/api/tokens/#delete-token) once it is no longer needed.
