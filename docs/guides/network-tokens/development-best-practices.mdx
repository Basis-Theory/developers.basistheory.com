## Development Best Practices

### Comprehensive Error Handling

Implement robust error handling for Network Token operations. Basis Theory provides specific error codes and retry guidance to help you handle different failure scenarios appropriately:

```javascript
try {
    const networkToken = await createNetworkToken(cardTokenId);
} catch (error) {
    // Handle specific error types with appropriate retry logic
    switch (error.title) {
        case 'CARD_NOT_ELIGIBLE':
            // Card is not eligible for network tokenization - do not retry
            console.log('Card not eligible for network tokenization, falling back to regular processing');
            // Fall back to regular card processing
            break;

        case 'CARD_VERIFICATION_FAILED':
            // Prompt user to re-enter CVV or card details - retryable
            console.log('Card verification failed - request user to re-enter card details');
            throw new Error('Please re-enter your card details');
            break;

        case 'PROVISION_DATA_EXPIRED':
            // Request updated card details from user - retryable
            console.log('Card data expired - request updated card details');
            throw new Error('Please provide updated card information');
            break;

        // ... additional error types available
        // See API documentation for complete list of error codes and retry guidance

        default:
            // Handle other unexpected errors
            console.error('Unexpected error during network tokenization:', error);
            throw error;
    }
}
```

### Testing

Use the provided [test cards](/docs/api/network-tokens/#error-handling-and-retries) to test different scenarios during development. These test cards simulate various success and error conditions you may encounter in production.

### Network Token Management

When managing Network Tokens for long-term storage and recurring transactions, consider these best practices to maximize security and operational efficiency:
- Store the Network Token ID in your database, not the raw card data.
- Use the stored token for future transactions, such as recurring billing or card-on-file scenarios.
- Monitor Webhook events for token updates to ensure you react promptly to changes.
- Handle token lifecycle changes appropriately to maintain seamless payment experiences for your customers.

Network Tokens are particularly beneficial for companies with large subscription customer bases who store many cards on file for recurring transactions.
