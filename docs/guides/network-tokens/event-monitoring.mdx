## Event Monitoring via Webhooks

Configure webhook endpoints to receive real-time notifications for critical Network Token lifecycle events. This enables proactive monitoring and automated response to Network Token status changes.

Available webhook events include:
- `network-token.created`: Triggered when a new Network Token is successfully created
- `network-token.cryptogram.created`: Triggered when a cryptogram is generated for a Network Token
- `network-token.deleted`: Triggered when a Network Token is permanently deleted
- `network-token.updated`: Triggered when a Network Token is updated by the card network or the state of the Network Token is changed
