## Preparing for Production

When you're ready to move to production:

1. **Enable Network Tokens**: Contact support@basistheory.com to enable Network Tokens for your production environment.

Additional considerations for production deployment:
- **Use Real Card Data**: Ensure usage in production uses real card data, not test cards. Continue using test environments for development and testing purposes
- **Understand Provider Integration**: Review how your payment provider accepts external network tokens to determine the appropriate integration approach (Reactors or Proxies)
- **Configure Production Webhooks**: Set up production webhook endpoints to monitor network token lifecycle events
