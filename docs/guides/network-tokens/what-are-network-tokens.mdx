## What are Network Tokens?

Network Tokens are cryptographically secure payment credentials issued directly by card networks (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover) that replace Primary Account Numbers (PANs) in payment transactions.

Unlike traditional card tokens that are issued by payment processors or gateways, Network Tokens are issued directly by the card networks themselves and adhere to industry-accepted [EMVCo specifications](https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/payment-tokenisation/). This allows Network Tokens to replace the customer's PAN at every step in the card payment lifecycleâ€”from merchant to acquiring bank to issuing bank.
