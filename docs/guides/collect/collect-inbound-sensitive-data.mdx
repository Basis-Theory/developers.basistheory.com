# Collect Inbound Sensitive Data

This guide will show you how to collect data sent to your API without touching the data.

Key concepts in this guide:

- [Tokens](/docs/concepts/what-are-tokens)
- [Applications](/docs/api/applications)
- [Proxy](/docs/concepts/what-is-the-proxy)

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need a Basis Theory account.

<AuthButtons />

Next you will need a [Management Application](/docs/api/applications#application-types) in order to provision the components in this guide.

[Click here](https://portal.basistheory.com/applications/create?application_template_id=931b306f-6be7-405d-9a8d-1442a99dd2d7) to create a Management Application or [login to your Basis Theory account](https://portal.basistheory.com/applications) and create a new application from the **Full Management Access** template.

<Alert>Save the API Key from the created Management Application as it will be used in this guide to provision everything.</Alert>

## Create a Public Application

We need a [Public Application](/docs/concepts/access-controls#application-type) to [create tokens](/docs/api/tokens#create-token) from the inbound data before it reaches our API:

```shell showLineNumbers
curl "https://api.basistheory.com/applications" \
  -H "BT-API-KEY: <API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X "POST" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Collect Public App",
    "type": "public",
    "permissions": [ "token:create" ]
  }'
```

<Alert>Be sure to replace <code>&lt;API_KEY></code> with the Management API Key you created in the <a href="#getting-started">Getting Started</a> step.</Alert>

<Alert>Save the application <code>id</code> from the created Public Application as it will be used to <a href="#create-the-proxy">create the proxy</a>.</Alert>

## Create the Proxy

We will [create a Proxy](/docs/api/proxies/pre-configured-proxies#create-a-proxy) capable of intercepting inbound calls to our API, tokenize part of the request, and send the modified request to our API.

The Basis Theory Proxy leverages a [request transform](/docs/api/proxies/pre-configured-proxies#request-transforms), which is executed in a secure Node.js 16 runtime. The following code will handle tokenizing the request:

```javascript showLineNumbers
module.exports = async function (req) {
  const socialSecurityNumber = req.args.body.socialSecurityNumber;

  const token = await req.bt.tokens.create({
    type: "token",
    data: socialSecurityNumber
  });

  return {
    headers: req.args.headers,
    body: {
      ...req.args.body,
      socialSecurityNumber: token.id
    }
  };
};
```

This code will read in the `socialSecurityNumber` property from the request body, tokenize it with a pre-configured [Basis Theory JS SDK](/docs/sdks/server-side/node) instance, and update the request body replacing the original `socialSecurityNumber` value with `id` of the token.

We need to create an instance of a Proxy with the previous code as a `request_transform`.

First, let's store the JavaScript code as a variable. In your terminal, run the following:

```shell showLineNumbers
javascript='module.exports = async function (req) {
  const socialSecurityNumber = req.args.body.socialSecurityNumber;

  const token = await req.bt.tokens.create({
    type: "token",
    data: socialSecurityNumber
  });

  return {
    headers: req.args.headers,
    body: {
      ...req.args.body,
      socialSecurityNumber: token.id
    }
  };
};'
```

Next, we need to create an instance of a Proxy, with the variable we created:

```shell showLineNumbers
curl "https://api.basistheory.com/proxies" \
  -H "BT-API-KEY: <API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X "POST" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Inbound Proxy Example",
    "destination_url": "https://echo.basistheory.com/anything",
    "request_transform": {
      "code": '"$(echo $javascript | jq -Rsa .)"'
    },
    "application": {
      "id": "45c124e7-6ab2-4899-b4d9-1388b0ba9d04"
    },
    "require_auth": false
  }'
```

<Alert>Be sure to replace <code>&lt;API_KEY></code> with the Management API Key you created in the <a href="#getting-started">Getting Started</a> step and replace <code>45c124e7-6ab2-4899-b4d9-1388b0ba9d04</code> with the <code>id</code> of the Public Application you created in the <a href="#create-a-public-application">Getting Started</a> step.</Alert>

<Alert>Save the proxy <code>key</code> from the response as it will be used to <a href="#invoke-the-proxy">invoke the proxy</a>.</Alert>

This is using `jq` to replace the JavaScript code as a JSON escaped string value. It will create a new Proxy instance where we will run the `request_transform` on the inbound Proxy request against the body and headers of the request. The proxy will then send the request to our `destination_url`, which should be your API URL. In this guide, we are going to use [https://echo.basistheory.com/anything](https://echo.basistheory.com/anything) so we can see the tokenized `socialSecurityNumber`.

## Invoke the Proxy

Now that we have our Proxy created, we need to invoke it. In your terminal run the following:

```shell showLineNumbers
curl "https://api.basistheory.com/proxy" \
  -H "BT-PROXY-KEY: TDEyQmkhQMpGiZd13FSRQ9" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X "POST" \
  -d '{
    "socialSecurityNumber": "123-45-6789"
  }'
```

<Alert>Be sure to replace <code>TDEyQmkhQMpGiZd13FSRQ9</code> with the <code>key</code> of the Proxy you created in the <a href="#create-the-proxy">Create the Proxy</a> step.</Alert>

If successful, you should see an output similar to this:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "args": {},
  "data": "{\"socialSecurityNumber\":\"8b4f3aab-abc6-423f-86b9-c368919bdc65\"}",
  "files": {},
  "form": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Accept-Encoding": "gzip",
    "Bt-Trace-Id": "0us+cYwAAAACCDkUl9kKnRY3yEEMzpsZ/Q0hHRURHRTE2MTkAMTYzY2E1ODMtNjQ3MS00MTc3LTg0ZGItZTA4MzBlZGFiODUw",
    "Content-Length": "63",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Disguised-Host": "echo.basistheory.com",
    "Host": "echo.basistheory.com",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.85.0",
    "X-Forwarded-Tlsversion": "1.2",
    "X-Original-Url": "/anything",
    "X-Waws-Unencoded-Url": "/anything"
  },
  "json": {
    "socialSecurityNumber": "8b4f3aab-abc6-423f-86b9-c368919bdc65"
  },
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://echo.basistheory.com/anything"
}
```

Notice that the `socialSecurityNumber` was successfully replaced with our tokenized value.

Now that you have your token, check out our guide on how to [send data to a third-party](/docs/guides/share/send-data-to-third-party)!
