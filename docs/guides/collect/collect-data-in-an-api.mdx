## Getting Started

To get started, you will need a Basis Theory account.

Next you will need a [Management Application](/docs/api/applications#application-types) in order to provision the components in this guide.

[Click here](https://portal.basistheory.com/applications/create?application_template_id=931b306f-6be7-405d-9a8d-1442a99dd2d7) to create a Management Application or [login to your Basis Theory account](https://portal.basistheory.com/applications) and create a new application from the **Full Management Access** template.
