Client-side encryption enables you to encrypt sensitive data in your frontend applications and send the encrypted payload to your backend for tokenization. This approach reduces latency, improves user experience, and gives you more control over when and how data is sent to Basis Theory.

## How Client-Side Encryption Works

1. **Generate encryption keys**: Create asymmetric key pairs using the [Client Encryption Keys API](/docs/api/client-keys)
2. **Client-side encryption**: Use the public key to encrypt token creation payloads in your frontend
3. **Backend tokenization**: Send encrypted payloads from your backend to create tokens
4. **Optimized workflow**: Provide immediate user feedback while maintaining security

## When to Use Client-Side Encryption

Use client-side encryption when you want to:
- **Reduce frontend latency**: Eliminate waiting for tokenization round-trips in your user interface
- **Improve user experience**: Provide immediate feedback while processing happens asynchronously
- **Maintain control**: Keep sensitive data encrypted until your backend is ready to process it
- **Optimize performance**: Handle tokenization on known infrastructure with reliable connections

## Key Benefits

### Reduced Latency
Encrypt data immediately in your frontend and provide instant user feedback, while tokenization happens asynchronously in your backend.

### Enhanced Control
Maintain full control over when and how sensitive data is processed, with encrypted payloads that remain secure until your backend is ready.

### Improved Performance
Leverage your backend infrastructure's reliable connections and processing power for tokenization operations.

### Seamless Integration
Works with existing Basis Theory Elements and APIs, requiring minimal changes to your current implementation.
