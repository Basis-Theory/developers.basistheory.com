# Display Masked Data

This guide will show you how to customize your data so you can securely display it while remaining compliant. We will leverage the concept of a `mask` to transform the underlying data prior to display.

Key concepts in this guide:

- [Token Masks](/docs/concepts/what-are-tokens#masking)
- [Expressions](/docs/expressions)

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need a Basis Theory account.

<AuthButtons />

Next you will need a [Private Application](/docs/api/applications#application-types) in order to create and retrieve a new token.

[Click here](https://portal.basistheory.com/applications/create?permissions=token%3Acreate&permissions=token%3Aread&type=private&name=Send%20Data%to%20Third%20Party%20Guide) to create a Private Application or [login to your Basis Theory account](https://portal.basistheory.com/applications) and create a new application with the following settings:

- Name - Send Data to Third Party Guide
- Application Type - Private
- Permissions - `token:create`, `token:use`

<Alert>
  Save the API Key from the created Private Application as it will be used later in this guide to create and retrieve tokens.
