### Creating a Private Application

Next you will need you'll need a [Private Application](/docs/api/applications) using our PCI-compliant template `Use PCI Tokens`. [Click here to create one.](https://portal.basistheory.com/applications/create?application_template_id=31efed55-035c-4b49-b1a1-609a728d91ce)

This will create an application with the following [Access Controls](/docs/concepts/access-controls):
* Permissions: `token:use`
* Containers: `/pci/`
* Transform: `reveal`

<Alert>
  Save the API Key from the created Private Application as it will be used later in this guide.
