# Send Data to a 3rd Party

This guide will show you how to send data to a third-party service without touching the data.

Key concepts in this guide:

- [Tokens](/docs/concepts/what-are-tokens)
- [Expressions](/docs/expressions)
- [Proxy](/docs/concepts/what-is-the-proxy)

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need a Basis Theory account.

<AuthButtons />

Next you will need a [Private Application](/docs/api/applications#application-types) in order to create a new token and use the token with the Proxy.

[Click here](https://portal.basistheory.com/applications/create?permissions=token%3Acreate&permissions=token%3Ause&type=private&name=Send%20Data%to%20Third%20Party%20Guide) to create a Private Application or [login to your Basis Theory account](https://portal.basistheory.com/applications) and create a new application with the following settings:

- Name - Send Data to Third Party Guide
- Application Type - Private
- Permissions - `token:create`, `token:use`

<Alert>
  Save the API Key from the created Private Application as it will be used later in this guide to capture the data and send it to a third-party.
</Alert>

## Create a Token

We will need to [create a token](/docs/api/tokens#create-token) to contain our data. Basis Theory offers several ways to capture this information [from your web application](/docs/guides/collect/collect-data-from-web) or [inbound to your API](/docs/guides/collect/collect-inbound-data-to-api) without touching the information, but for this guide, we will create the token directly against the Basis Theory API.

Run the following in your terminal to create a token containing a phone number:

```shell showLineNumbers
curl "https://api.basistheory.com/tokens" \
-X "POST" \
-H "BT-API-KEY: test_1234567890" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "type": "token",
    "data": "(555) 687-5309"
}'
```

<Alert>
  Be sure to replace <code>test_1234567890</code> with the Private API Key you created in the <a href="#getting-started">Getting Started</a> step.
</Alert>

You should see a JSON response similar to:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "id": "adb7ef72-73ca-4166-bc68-b77949a55f75",
  "type": "token",
  "tenant_id": "4d228c59-13e9-4d26-9ff3-883336579d35",
  "created_by": "59929b69-1282-43e1-8b26-8cf655964f9b",
  "created_at": "2022-12-19T19:20:43.7334616+00:00",
  "fingerprint": "4CCkxuF2Gp5a5fnnc1Esxe1eANXao1g3ASMqHsTV9Adr",
  "fingerprint_expression": "{{ data | stringify }}",
  "containers": [
    "/general/high/"
  ]
}
```

Copy the `id` to use in the next step.

<Alert type={Alerts.INFO}>
  It is best practice to securely collect your data from a <a href="/docs/guides/collect/collect-data-from-web">web form</a> or <a href="/docs/guides/collect/collect-inbound-data-to-api">API</a> to avoid security and compliance risks associated with directly handling the sensitive data.
</Alert>

## Send the Data

We can leverage the [Basis Theory Proxy](/docs/concepts/what-is-the-proxy) to be able to detokenize the stored data before forwarding it to a third-party. To do this, we will utilize [Expressions](/docs/expressions), which is based on the [Liquid template language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid).

```bash showLineNumbers
curl "https://api.basistheory.com/proxy" \
-X "POST" \
-H "BT-API-KEY: test_1234567890" \
-H "BT-PROXY-URL: https://echo.basistheory.com/anything" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
      "phoneNumber": {
        "full": "+1 {{ adb7ef72-73ca-4166-bc68-b77949a55f75 }}",
        "countryCode": "+1",
        "areaCode": "{{ adb7ef72-73ca-4166-bc68-b77949a55f75 | split: \" \" | first | remove: \"(\" | remove: \")\" }}",
        "exchangeCode": "{{ adb7ef72-73ca-4166-bc68-b77949a55f75  | split: \"-\" | last }}",
        "lineNumber": "{{ adb7ef72-73ca-4166-bc68-b77949a55f75 | split: \" \" | last | split: \"-\" | first }}"
      }
    }'
```

<Alert>
  Be sure to replace <code>test_1234567890</code> with the Private API Key you created in the <a href="#getting-started">Getting Started</a> step and replace 
  <code>adb7ef72-73ca-4166-bc68-b77949a55f75</code> with the token <code>id</code> you created in the <a href="#create-a-token">Create a Token</a> step.
</Alert>

You should see a response similar to:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "args": {},
  "data": "{\"phoneNumber\":{\"full\":\"+1 8675309\",\"countryCode\":\"+1\",\"areaCode\":\"8675309\",\"exchangeCode\":\"8675309\",\"lineNumber\":\"8675309\"}}",
  "files": {},
  "form": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Accept-Encoding": "gzip",
    "Bt-Trace-Id": "0kr2gYwAAAACKcnGsnP/NTrEa4nIHenpYQ0hHRURHRTE1MTAAMTYzY2E1ODMtNjQ3MS00MTc3LTg0ZGItZTA4MzBlZGFiODUw",
    "Content-Length": "125",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Disguised-Host": "echo.basistheory.com",
    "Host": "echo.basistheory.com",
    "Max-Forwards": "10",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.85.0"
  },
  "json": {
    "phoneNumber": {
      "areaCode": "8675309",
      "countryCode": "+1",
      "exchangeCode": "8675309",
      "full": "+1 8675309",
      "lineNumber": "8675309"
    }
  },
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://echo.basistheory.com/anything"
}
```

## Conclusion

Basis Theory's Proxy will intercept the sent request and [evaluate and detokenize](/docs/expressions/detokenization) the request body. Basis Theory will then forward the request onto the configured `BT-PROXY-URL`, in this example is [https://echo.basistheory.com/anything](https://echo.basistheory.com/).

[Creating a pre-configured Proxy](/docs/api/proxies#create-a-proxy) provides additional capabilities such as the ability to execute custom transforms on the request and response bodies.

You can use this guide as an example on how to easily forward any piece of information and transform the request prior to sending to the destination.
