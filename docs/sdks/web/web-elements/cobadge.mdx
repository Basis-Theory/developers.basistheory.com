# Co-Badge Support

Co-badge support allows the Card Element to handle cards that support multiple payment networks, giving users the ability to choose which network to use for processing their payment. This feature is particularly important in regions where co-branded cards are common.

## Overview

When a card supports multiple payment networks (co-badged), the Card Element can detect this and allow users to select their preferred network. Currently, Basis Theory supports co-badge functionality for **Cartes Bancaires** cards, which are commonly co-badged with Visa or Mastercard in France.

## Enabling Co-Badge Support

To enable co-badge support on your Card Element, include the `coBadgedSupport` property in your element configuration:

<Tabs className="bt-tabs">
  <TabItem value="js" label="Web Elements">

```javascript
// Create a Card Element with co-badge support
const cardElement = bt.createElement('card', {
  targetId: 'my-card',
  coBadgedSupport: ['cartes-bancaires'],
  onChange: (event) => {
    // Handle network selection events
    if (event.selectedNetwork) {
      console.log('Selected network:', event.selectedNetwork);
    }
  }
});

// Mount the element
cardElement.mount('#card-container');
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="react" label="React Elements">

```jsx
import { CardElement } from "@basis-theory/react-elements";

function PaymentForm() {
  const handleCardChange = (event) => {
    // Handle network selection events
    if (event.selectedNetwork) {
      console.log('Selected network:', event.selectedNetwork);
    }
  };

  return (
    <CardElement 
      id="my-card"
      coBadgedSupport={['cartes-bancaires']}
      onChange={handleCardChange}
    />
  );
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Supported Co-Badge Networks

| Network | Identifier | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Cartes Bancaires | `cartes-bancaires` | French domestic payment scheme, often co-badged with Visa or Mastercard |

<Alert type={Alerts.WARNING}>Adding unsupported networks will result in an error. Additional co-badge networks may be supported in future releases.</Alert>

## Co-Badge Events

When co-badge support is enabled, the Card Element emits additional event data that allows your application to respond to network selection changes.

### Change Event with Co-Badge Data

The `change` event includes a `selectedNetwork` property when co-badge support is enabled and a user selects a network:

```javascript
{
  cardBin: "123456",
  cardBrand: "visa",
  cardLast4: "1234",
  complete: true,
  empty: false,
  errors: [],
  maskSatisfied: true,
  valid: true,
  binInfo: { /* BIN information */ },
  selectedNetwork: "cartes-bancaires"  // The user's selected network
}
```
