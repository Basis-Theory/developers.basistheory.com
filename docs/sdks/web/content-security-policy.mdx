# Content Security Policy

If you have a [CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) deployed in your website, you must include the following directives when using our web SDKs:

- `script-src` - _https://*.basistheory.com_
- `frame-src` - _https://*.basistheory.com_

```html showLineNumbers title="CSP"
<head>
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
    content="frame-src https://*.basistheory.com; script-src https://*.basistheory.com" />
</head>
```

<Alert type={Alerts.INFO}>
  It is strongly recommended to implement a CSP in your website to help <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Content_Security_Policy_Cheat_Sheet.html#context" target="_blank">mitigate attacks</a> such as Cross Site Scripting (XSS).
</Alert>

## Optional Sources

The sources mentioned earlier are essential for the SDK to work properly. However, you may also need to include the following sources that support our services:

### Datadog

[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) is used by BasisTheory for logging and debugging for errors.
If you don't allow the connection to Datadog in your CSP, it may be more difficult for Basis Theory to help with issues.

To allow the connection to Datadog, add the following directive to your CSP:

- `connect-src` - _https://*.browser-intake-datadoghq.com_

### LaunchDarkly

[LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/) is used by BasisTheory to evaluate feature flags before new Elements features are released.
If you don't allow the connection to LaunchDarkly in your CSP, it won't be possible for your organization to test new features before they are released.

To allow the connection to LaunchDarkly, add the following directive to your CSP:

- `connect-src` - _https://*.launchdarkly.com_

## Trusted Types

If you are using [Trusted Types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/require-trusted-types-for), you must allow dynamic script loading from the _https://js.basistheory.com_ origin. This should be done **BEFORE** [initialization](/docs/sdks/web/javascript#initialization).

```javascript showLineNumbers title="Trusted Types"
trustedTypes.createPolicy("default", {
  createScriptURL: (input) => {
    if (new URL(input).origin === "https://js.basistheory.com") {
      return input;
    }
    return undefined;
  }
});
```

## Common CSP Errors

The setup above is recommended to avoid errors similar to these:

<Alert type={Alerts.WARNING}>
  Refused to load the script '&lt;URL&gt;' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: (...).```
</Alert>

<Alert type={Alerts.WARNING}>
  Refused to frame 'https://js.basistheory.com/' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: (...). Note that 'frame-src' was not explicitly set, so (...) is used as a fallback.
</Alert>

<Alert type={Alerts.WARNING}>
  Failed to set the 'src' property on 'HTMLScriptElement': This document requires 'TrustedScriptURL' assignment.
</Alert>
