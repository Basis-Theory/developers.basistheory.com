Our Elements enable you to convert proxy responses into plain text, which is ideal for non-sensitive data handling. This enhancement streamlines your data processing workflows and facilitates an easier understanding of the returned data, bypassing decryption or tokenization.

Basis Theory remains committed to advancing your data compliance and security, and this feature is a testament to that commitment. This feature is currently invite-only. If you're interested, please <Link to="https://basistheory.com/contact" target="_blank<">get in touch</Link> for an invitation.

Converting proxy responses to plain text can expose the underlying data to risks, such as unauthorized access or leakage. Ensure the plain-text proxy responses align with your data security policy, data handling practices, and compliance obligations. If you're unsure, please get in touch for guidance at{" "}
