# JavaScript Elements SDK

**Basis Theory Elements** are secure inputs that empower developers to easily collect or reveal sensitive data within 
web or mobile applications. 

Think about it as an isolated sandbox within your frontend application that your end users are able to seamlessly 
interact with, and which securely communicates with the Basis Theory Vault. Sensitive data is not directly exposed to
your application code, which keeps your frontend systems out of compliance scope.

Here's how we make this possible:

- Integrate our web and mobile SDKs into your frontend applications
- Build forms using our **Element** input components
- Interact with the Basis Theory API using **Element** references, not plaintext data
- Own your UI/UX by fully customizing how **Elements** are styled

**Collect Sensitive Data**

Data entered by your end users into **Elements** is tokenized and secured within Basis Theory's certified Vault.

Our SDKs provide several types of inputs to collect various types of data, such as the [CardElement](/docs/sdks/web/elements/types#card-element)
for collecting credit card data and [TextElement](/docs/sdks/web/elements/types##text-element) for collecting arbitrary textual data.

Elements can be configured to support custom input masking, validation, and transformation rules to satisfy your use cases.

**Reveal Sensitive Data**

Tokens stored within the Basis Theory Vault can be securely revealed to end users without accessing the plaintext
data directly within your application code.

Using one of our SDKs, sensitive data can be securely retrieved and applied to one or more Elements within your UI.
See the section below on [detokenization](/docs/sdks/web/elements/methods#detokenization) for more information.

<Alert>
  Revealing sensitive data is only currently supported within the JavaScript and React SDKs. We are working to fully 
  support this functionality within our native <a href="#android">Android</a> and <a href="#ios">iOS</a> SDKs. Interested?
  Please email us at <a href="mailto:info@basistheory.com?subject=Mobile Elements SDK - Reveal">info@basistheory.com</a> 
  to join our early access program.

## Before You Begin

Basis Theory Elements require the use of an API Key associated with a **Public Application**, which only allows the use of `token:create` and `token:update` permissions, removing any risk that your API keys are stolen and used to access data.

To create one, login into our [Portal](https://portal.basistheory.com) and create a new "Public" Application with the permissions you require.

## Installation

To install **BasisTheory.js** you can choose either our ES module or CDN hosted bundle through a `script` tag.

<Tabs className="bt-tabs">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```shell showLineNumbers
npm install --save @basis-theory/basis-theory-js
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```shell showLineNumbers
yarn add @basis-theory/basis-theory-js
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cdn" label="CDN">

```html showLineNumbers
<!-- Including this tag will export a global/window "BasisTheory" variable -->
<script src="https://js.basistheory.com"></script>
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Initialization

Initialize `BasisTheory` with `elements: true` to dynamically loads **Elements** module.

<Tabs className="bt-tabs">
  <TabItem value="module" label="ES Module">

```javascript showLineNumbers
import { BasisTheory } from "@basis-theory/basis-theory-js";

// In this context BasisTheory is a class
const bt = await new BasisTheory().init("test_1234567890", { elements: true });
// use Elements
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cdn" label="CDN">

```html showLineNumbers
<script>
  // you can initialize it wherever it suits your workflow best
  // here we are waiting for the window to load, to make sure BasisTheory instance
  // has been injected in the window variable
  window.addEventListener('load', async () => {
    try {
      // global/window variable BasisTheory is an instance, but requires initialization
      await BasisTheory.init('test_1234567890', { elements: true });
      // use Elements
    } catch (e) {
      // handle errors that could happen while loading elements script
    }
  });
</script>
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Alert type={Alerts.WARNING}>
  Elements are meant to be used in browser environments only. If you installed <code>BasisTheory.js</code> as a module, make sure the instance that loads elements runs on the browser-side code.
</Alert>

<Alert type={Alerts.WARNING}>
  If you try to to use any Elements feature before calling <code>BasisTheory.init</code>, or before its Promise has been fulfilled, you will get an error.
</Alert>

## Usage with TypeScript

Starting at `1.14.0`, [BasisTheory.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@basis-theory/basis-theory-js) bundles all TypeScript definitions for Elements features. You don't have to take any extra steps in order to use it.
