<Alert>Some card brands have issued card numbers with multiple lengths. The <code>Card Number Digits</code> column documents all acceptable card number lengths for the brand (in number of digits, excluding formatting characters).</Alert>
<Alert>Vault and Elements may return different card brands. While we aim for consistency, Vault might include brands that Elements doesn't support, and its brand identifiers may differ slightly in format. Refer to the [Tokens Card Brands Table](/docs/api/tokens/#card-brands) for differences.</Alert>
