Our Elements enable you to convert proxy responses into plain text, which is ideal for non-sensitive data handling. This enhancement streamlines your data processing workflows and facilitates an easier understanding of the returned data, bypassing decryption or tokenization.

This feature is currently invite-only. If you're interested, please <Link to="https://basistheory.com/contact" target="_blank<">get in touch</Link> for an invitation.

<Alert type={Alerts.WARNING}>You can capture values from any of our Elements; hence we strongly recommend only using this feature for non-sensitive data. Converting proxy responses to plain text can expose the underlying data to risks, such as unauthorized access or leakage. Ensure the plain-text proxy responses align with your data security policy, data handling practices, and compliance obligations.
