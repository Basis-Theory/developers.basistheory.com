###

The Basis Theory iOS SDK makes it easy to build secure iOS applications that
[collect](/docs/concepts/elements#collect-sensitive-data) or [reveal](/docs/concepts/elements#reveal-sensitive-data)
sensitive data using [Elements](/docs/concepts/elements).

Get started with our [native iOS guide](/docs/guides/collect/collect-data-with-ios) or [React Native iOS guide](/docs/guides/collect/collect-data-with-react-native-on-ios), explore our
[example application](https://github.com/Basis-Theory/basistheory-ios/tree/master/IntegrationTester),
or continue reading the [reference docs](/docs/sdks/mobile/ios/types).

## Before You Begin

This SDK requires the use of an API Key associated with a **Public Application**, which only allows `token:create` or `token:update`
permissions to mitigate the risk that these API keys may be publicly exposed within your frontend applications.

To create one, login into our [Portal](https://portal.basistheory.com) and create a new "Public" Application with the permissions you require.

## Installation

To add the Basis Theory iOS package using [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/), open XCode and click on `File â†’ Add Packages`, search for `"https://github.com/Basis-Theory/basistheory-ios"`, and click on `Copy Dependency`.

We also support installing our package via [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) by adding the following line to your `Podfile` under your `target`:

```shell
pod 'BasisTheoryElements'
```

## Initialization

To initialize our elements, you'll need to set a custom class on each of the `UITextField`s that need to be configured as one of our secure elements.
Below is an example of a UITextField set as `TextElementUITextField`.

## UITextFieldDelegate

If you want to use methods available from [UITextFieldDelegate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextfielddelegate) you'll need to have your [UIViewController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller)
inherit from the `BasisTheoryUIViewController` class. It should look something like this:

```swift showLineNumbers
import UIKit
import BasisTheoryElements

class ViewController: BasisTheoryUIViewController {
  @IBOutlet weak var textField: TextElementUITextField!

  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    textField.delegate = self
    ...
  }
}
```

The `BasisTheoryUIViewController` class inherits from [UIViewController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller) and [UITextFieldDelegate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextfielddelegate) to safely
expose methods on [UITextFieldDelegate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextfielddelegate). To ensure you're not exposed to any sensitive data, the following functions are unavailable to be overridden:

* [`textField(_:shouldChangeCharactersIn:replacementString:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextfielddelegate/1619599-textfield) - this function will always return `true`

## Styling Elements

All of our elements have been designed to take advantage of the pre-existing native properties and customizations built directly into the [UIKit framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit). Utilizing this framework means you're able to customize the styling of your elements as you would with any other `UITextField`. For example:

```swift showLineNumbers
@IBOutlet weak var myTextElement: TextElementUITextField!
...

myTextElement.layer.cornerRadius = 15.0
myTextElement.placeholder = placeholder
myTextElement.backgroundColor = UIColor( red: 240/255, green: 240/255, blue: 240/255, alpha: 1.0 )
```

## Modified and Additional Fields

`BasisTheoryElements` package's elements are a simple wrapper for the native [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit) UITextField. Due to this developers can take full advantage of existing native customization, but we restrict and enable access to the underlying data in the following ways:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| text | We restrict the getter for this value; it always returns nil. The setter works as is. |
| subject | An instance of [PassThroughSubject](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/passthroughsubject) that allows you to subscribe to [ElementEvents](/docs/sdks/mobile/ios/events). |
| setValue | A function that recieves an `ElementValueReference` parameter to set the value of the element. Note: `ElementValueReference` instances can only be retrieved from [proxy](/docs/sdks/mobile/ios/services#proxy) responses. |
| setValueRef | Binds the provided element instance as a value source for the calling element, keeping the value of the calling element in sync with any changes made to the provided element. This makes the caller element read-only. Any iOS element type can be provided as an instance into this function. |
| setConfig | A function that allows you to set a [mask](/docs/sdks/mobile/ios/options#mask) and [transform](/docs/sdks/mobile/ios/options#transform) on [TextElementUITextField's](/docs/sdks/mobile/ios/types#textelementuitextfield), and [associate a CardNumberUITextField to a CardVerificationCodeUITextField](/docs/sdks/mobile/ios/types#associating-a-cardnumberuitextfield). |
| metadata  | An object that contains [metadata](/docs/sdks/mobile/ios/events#using-metadata-for-event-values) about the element state in regards to its value.
| cardMetadata | An object that contains metadata about the card number for the [`CardNumberUITextField`](/docs/sdks/mobile/ios/types#cardnumberuitextfield) element type only.
