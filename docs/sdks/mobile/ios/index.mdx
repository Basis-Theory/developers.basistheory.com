###

Basis Theory iOS Elements are simple, secure, developer-friendly inputs that empower consumers to collect sensitive data from their users directly to Basis Theory's certified vault.

Think about it as an isolated sandbox within your mobile application that your end users are able to seamlessly
interact with, and which securely communicates with the Basis Theory Vault. Sensitive data is not directly exposed to
your application code, which keeps your mobile application out of compliance scope.

Here's how we make this possible:

- [Install](#installation) our iOS SDK into your mobile application
- Build forms using our **[Element](./types)** input components
- Interact with the Basis Theory API using **Element** references, not plaintext data
- Own your UI/UX by fully customizing how **Elements** are styled

## Collect Sensitive Data

Data entered by your end users into **iOS Elements** is tokenized and secured within Basis Theory's certified Vault.

Our SDKs provide several types of inputs to collect various types of data, such as the [TextElementUITextField](./types##text-element-ui-text-field)
for collecting arbitrary textual data and [CardNumberUITextField](./types##card-number-ui-text-field) for collecting a credit card number.

Elements can be configured to support custom input [masking](./options/#mask), validation, and [transformation](./options/#transform) rules to satisfy your use cases.

## Reveal Sensitive Data

Tokens stored within the Basis Theory Vault can be securely revealed to end users without accessing the plaintext
data directly within your application code.

<Alert>
  The ability to reveal sensitive data on iOS is not yet generally available. If you are interested in using this feature on iOS,
  please email us at <a href="mailto:info@basistheory.com?subject=iOS SDK - Reveal">info@basistheory.com</a> to
  join our early access program.
</Alert>

## Before You Begin

Basis Theory iOS Elements require the use of an API Key associated with a **Public Application**, which only allows `token:create` and `token:update` permissions to mitigate the risk that these API keys may be publicly exposed within your frontend applications.

To create one, login into our [Portal](https://portal.basistheory.com) and create a new "Public" Application with the permissions you require.

## Installation

Add the Basis Theory iOS package using [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/) via [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). To do this, follow these steps.

1. Via File -> Add Packages, search for "https://github.com/Basis-Theory/basistheory-ios" and click on "Copy Dependency".

2. Add the following line under `dependencies` to `Package.swift`.

```swift showLineNumbers
.package(url: "https://github.com/Basis-Theory/basistheory-ios", from: "X.X.X")
```

3. Then, add `BasisTheoryElements` as a dependency to your target.

```swift showLineNumbers
dependencies: [
    .product(name: "BasisTheoryElements", package: "basistheory-ios"),
    ...
]
```

4. Add the following line to your Podfile under your target.

```ruby showLineNumbers
pod 'BasisTheoryElements'
```

## Initialization

To initialize our elements, you’ll need to set a custom class on each of the `UITextField`s that need to be configured as one of our secure elements.
Below is an example of a UITextField set as `TextElementUITextField`.

## Customizing Elements

All of our elements have been designed to take advantage of the pre-existing native properties and customizations built directly into the [UIKit framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit). Utilizing this framework means you’re able to customize the styling of your elements as you would with any other `UITextField`. For example:

```swift showLineNumbers
@IBOutlet weak var myTextElement: TextElementUITextField!
...

myTextElement.layer.cornerRadius = 15.0
myTextElement.placeholder = placeholder
myTextElement.backgroundColor = UIColor( red: 240/255, green: 240/255, blue: 240/255, alpha: 1.0 )
```

## Modified and Additional Fields

`BasisTheoryElements` package’s elements are a simple wrapper for the native [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit) UITextField. Due to this developers can take full advantage of existing native customization, but we restrict and enable access to the underlying data in the following ways:

| Fields | Description |
| --- | --- |
| text | We restrict the getter for this value; it always returns nil. The setter works as is. |
| subject | An instance of PassThroughSubject that allows you to subscribe to [ElementEvents](/docs/sdks/mobile/ios/events). |
| setValue | A function that recieves an `ElementValueReference` parameter to set the value of the element. Note: `ElementValueReference` instances can only be retrieved from [proxy](/docs/sdks/mobile/ios/services#proxy) responses. |
