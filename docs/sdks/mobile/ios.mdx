# iOS Elements SDK

Basis Theory iOS Elements are simple, secure, developer-friendly inputs that empower consumers to collect sensitive data from their users directly to Basis Theory’s certified vault.

Think about it as an isolated sandbox within your mobile application that your end users are able to seamlessly
interact with, and which securely communicates with the Basis Theory Vault. Sensitive data is not directly exposed to
your application code, which keeps your mobile application out of compliance scope.

Here is how we make this possible:

- Own your UX, by fully customizing how iOS Elements are styled
- Use inputs and forms with ease
- Interact with iOS Elements just like native elements

### Collect Sensitive Data

Data entered by your end users into **iOS Elements** is tokenized and secured within Basis Theory's certified Vault.

Our SDKs provide several types of inputs to collect various types of data, such as the [TextElementUITextField](./elements/types##text-element-ui-text-field)
for collecting arbitrary textual data and [CardNumberUITextField](./elements/types##card-number-ui-text-field) for collecting a credit card number.

Elements can be configured to support custom input [masking](./elements/options/#mask), validation, and [transformation](./elements/options/#transform) rules to satisfy your use cases.

## Before You Begin

Basis Theory iOS Elements require the use of an API Key associated with a **Public Application**, which only allows `token:create` and `token:update` permissions, removing any risk that your API keys are stolen and used to access data.

To create one, login into our [Portal](https://portal.basistheory.com) and create a new "Public" Application with the permissions you require.

## Installation

Add the Basis Theory iOS package using <a href="https://www.swift.org/package-manager/">Swift Package Manager</a> via <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">
XCode</a>. To do this, follow these steps.

1. Via File -> Add Packages, search for "https://github.com/Basis-Theory/basistheory-ios" and click on "Copy Dependency".

2. Add the following line under `dependencies` to `Package.swift`.

```swift showLineNumbers
.package(url: "https://github.com/Basis-Theory/basistheory-ios", from: "X.X.X"),
```

3. Then, add `BasisTheoryElements` as a dependency to your target.

```swift showLineNumbers
dependencies: [
    .product(name: "BasisTheoryElements", package: "basistheory-ios"),
    ...
],
```

4. Add the following line to your Podfile under your target.

```swift showLineNumbers
pod 'BasisTheoryElements'
```

## Initialization

To initialize our elements, you’ll need to set a custom class on each of the `UITextField`s that need to be configured as one of our secure elements.
Below is an example of a UITextField set as `TextElementUITextField`.
