###

Basis Theory Android Elements are simple, secure, developer-friendly inputs that empower consumers to collect sensitive data from their users directly to Basis Theory's certified vault.

Think about it as an isolated sandbox within your mobile application that your end users are able to seamlessly
interact with, and which securely communicates with the Basis Theory Vault. Sensitive data is not directly exposed to
your application code, which keeps your mobile application out of compliance scope.

Here is how we make this possible:

- Own your UX, by fully customizing how Android Elements are styled
- Use inputs and forms with ease
- Interact with Android Elements just like native elements
