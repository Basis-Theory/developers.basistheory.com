###

Basis Theory Android Elements are simple, secure, developer-friendly inputs that empower consumers to collect sensitive data from their users directly to Basis Theory's certified vault.

Think about it as an isolated sandbox within your mobile application that your end users are able to seamlessly
interact with, and which securely communicates with the Basis Theory Vault. Sensitive data is not directly exposed to
your application code, which keeps your mobile application out of compliance scope.

Here's how we make this possible:

- [Install](#installation) our Android SDK into your mobile application
- Build forms using our **[Element](./types)** input components
- [Interact](./services#basistheoryelements) with the Basis Theory API using **Element** references, not plaintext data
- Own your UI/UX by fully customizing how **Elements** are [styled](./options#styling)

## Collect Sensitive Data

Data entered by your end users into **Elements** is tokenized and secured within Basis Theory's certified Vault.

Our SDKs provide several types of inputs to collect various types of data, such as the [CardNumberElement](./types#cardnumberelement)
for collecting credit card data and [TextElement](./types#textelement) for collecting arbitrary textual data.

Elements can be configured to support custom input masking, validation, and transformation rules to satisfy your use cases.

## Reveal Sensitive Data

Tokens stored within the Basis Theory Vault can be securely revealed to end users without accessing the plaintext
data directly within your application code.

<Alert>
  The ability to reveal sensitive data on Android is not yet generally available. If you are interested in using this feature on Android,
  please email us at <a href="mailto:info@basistheory.com?subject=Android SDK - Reveal">info@basistheory.com</a> to
  join our early access program.
</Alert>

## Before You Begin

Basis Theory Android Elements require the use of an API Key associated with a **Public Application**, which only allows `token:create` and `token:update` permissions to mitigate the risk that these API keys may be publicly exposed within your frontend applications.

To create one, login into our [Portal](https://portal.basistheory.com) and create a new "Public" Application with the permissions you require.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Android 5.0+ (API level 21+)
- AndroidX

### Gradle

Add this dependency to your project's build file:

```groovy
  repositories {
      maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }

  dependencies {
      implementation 'com.github.basis-theory:basistheory-android:<version>'
  }
```

The latest release version can be found in [GitHub](https://github.com/Basis-Theory/basistheory-android/tags).

## Basic Usage

Simply include one or more elements within your application's views:

```xml showLineNumbers
<com.basistheory.android.view.CardNumberElement
    android:id="@+id/card_number"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" />

<com.basistheory.android.view.CardExpirationDateElement
    android:id="@+id/expiration_date"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" />

<com.basistheory.android.view.CardVerificationCodeElement
    android:id="@+id/cvc"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```

Then tokenize the user input by referencing these elements. This can be wired up in response to a
button click, or any other user action.

```kotlin showLineNumbers
val cardNumberElement = findViewById(R.id.card_number)
val cardExpirationDateElement = findViewById(R.id.expiration_date)
val cardVerificationCodeElement = findViewById(R.id.cvc)

val bt = BasisTheoryElements.builder()
    .apiKey(myPublicApiKey)
    .build()

runBlocking {
    val tokenizeResponse = bt.tokenize(object {
        val type = "card"
        val data = object {
            val number = cardNumberElement
            val expiration_month = cardExpirationDateElement.month()
            val expiration_year = cardExpirationDateElement.year()
            val cvc = cardVerificationCodeElement
        }
    })

    // send the tokens within tokenizeResponse to your backend
}
```

A full example Android app is included within the [example](https://github.com/Basis-Theory/basistheory-android/tree/master/example)
module within the GitHub repo or explore all the supported [Element Types](./types).
