Express Checkout allows customers to quickly and securely complete purchases using stored payment methods. As a Customer-Initiated Transaction (CIT), it requires the cardholder's active participation, ensuring compliance with security standards while providing a seamless checkout experience.
This guide will demonstrate how to implement these streamlined payment flows effectively using previously saved tokens.

If you are not yet tokenizing cards with Basis Theory, here are a few guides that you can explore:

- [Accept Card Payments](/docs/online-payments/accept-card-payments) - start collecting cards in your checkout page
- [Add Card on File](/docs/online-payments/add-card-on-file) - enable customers to add cards to their profile or wallet
- [Issue Cards](/docs/guides/collect/issue-cards) - create brand-new cards using an Issuer API;
- [Import Cards from a Payments Processor](/docs/blueprints/migrations/import-cards-on-file) - migrate to Basis Theory
