When building an e-commerce platform, subscription service, or any system that processes payments, securely collecting and managing cardholder data is a critical step. This includes not only capturing card information but also verifying its validity and storing it securely for future use. With the added complexities of payments orchestration—such as managing multiple processors for global coverage, disaster recovery, or authentication failover—merchants need a solution that simplifies these challenges.

In this guide, you'll learn how to use Basis Theory platform to capture and verify cardholder data from a customer, and tokenize it securely for later charging it.

## Process Cards

In this section, we'll explore how to verify a card and securely long-term persist it for future transactions.

    participant mapi as Merchant<br>API
    participant bapi as Basis Theory<br>API
    participant psp as Payments Processor<br>API

    activate mapi
    mapi ->>+ bapi: Verify Card using Token Intent
    bapi ->> bapi: Detokenize card data
    bapi ->>+ psp: Verify Card using card data
    psp -->>- bapi: Response
    bapi -->>- mapi: Response
    opt Card is Valid
      mapi ->>+ bapi: Persist Card
      bapi -->>- mapi: Token
    end
    deactivate mapi
```

We will use Basis Theory [Ephemeral Proxy API](/docs/api/proxies/ephemeral-proxy), a tool that transparently performs detokenization, to share the sensitive cardholder data to the Payments Processor or Acquirer API. To do this, we will formulate our HTTPS request as if we were directly connecting to the target endpoint, with the following variations:

1. Use a [Private Application Key](#private-application) as the value of the `BT-API-KEY` header;
2. Specify the target API endpoint as the value for the `BT-PROXY-URL` header;
3. Pass any additional headers you need the target API to receive, for example `Authorization`, `X-API-KEY`, etc.;
4. Replace the plaintext sensitive cardholder data in the expected payload contents with [detokenization expressions](/docs/expressions/detokenization) that contains token identifiers.
