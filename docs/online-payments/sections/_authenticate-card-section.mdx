### Authenticate Card

Once the Token Intent has been created, depending on the merchant's risk appetite or the region in which the card belongs, a merchant can run various actions against the user and card to ensure they are authenticated to use the card for a purchase.

#### 3D Secure

3D Secure (3DS) is a payment authentication protocol that adds an extra layer of verification, such as a one-time password or biometric scan, to enhance security and reduce fraud during online transactions. It is commonly used to meet Secure Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements under regulations like PSD2.
