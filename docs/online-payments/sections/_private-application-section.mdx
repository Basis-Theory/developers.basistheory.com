### Private Application

To start interacting with the Basis Theory API via server-to-server, you will need a [Private Application](/docs/api/applications/#application-types) for your backend. [Click here to create one](https://portal.basistheory.com/applications/create?name=Collect+Cards&type=private&permissions=token%3Ause&permissions=token%3Acreate) using the Basis Theory Customer Portal.

This will create an application with the following [Access Controls](/docs/concepts/access-controls):
* Permissions: `token:use`, `token:create`

<Alert>Save the API Key from the created Private Application as it will be used later in this guide.</Alert>
